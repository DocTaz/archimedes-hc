THE CATTLE-PROBLEM. 



IT is required to find the number of bulls and cows of each 
of four colours, or to find 8 unknown quantities. The first 
part of the problem connects the unknowns by seven simple 
equations ; and the second part adds two more conditions to 
which the unknowns must be subject. 

Let W, w be the numbers of white bulls and cows respectively, 
X,x black 

Yy y >, yellow 

Z, z dappled

Second part. 

W+X = * square ............................. (0), 

Y+ Z = & triangular number ............... (A).

[There is an ambiguity in the language which expresses the 
condition (0). Literally the lines mean " When the white bulls 
joined in number with the black, they stood firm (fyTreSov) 
with depth and breadth of equal measurement (tVo/ierpot els 
/8odo? it? evpos re) ; and the plains of Thrinakia, far-stretching 
all ways, were filled with their multitude" (reading, with 
Krumbiegel, 7r\r)0ov$ instead of irKivOov). Considering that, if 
the bulls were packed together so as to form a square figure, 
the number of them need not be a square number, since a bull 
is longer than it is broad, it is clear that one possible interpre- 
tation would be to take the 'square* to be a square figure, and 
to understand condition (0) to be simply 

W+ J5T=a rectangle (i.e. a product of two factors). 

The problem may therefore be stated in two forms : 

(1) the simpler one in which, for the condition (0), there is 
substituted the mere requirement that 

TF-f X = a product of two whole numbers ; 

(2) the complete problem in which all the conditions have to 
be satisfied including the requirement (0) that 

TF+ X = a square number. 

The simpler problem was solved by Jul. Fr. Wurm and may 
be called 

Wurm's Problem. 

The solution of this is given (together with a discussion of 
the complete problem) by Amthor in the Zeitschrift fur Math, 
u. Physik (Hist. litt. Abtheilung), XXV. (1880), p. 156 sqq. 

Multiply (a) by 336, (ft) by 280, (7) by 126, and add ; thus 

297TT = 742F, or 3'. 11TF= 2.7.53F (of). 

Then from (7) and (ft) we obtain 

89LZ=1580F, or 3M1Z= 2 f . 5.79F (/SO, 

and 99Z = 178F, or 3*. 1LAT = 2. 89F (7'). 

Again, if we multiply (8) by 4800, (e) by 2800, (?) by 1260, 
(17) by 462, and add, we obtain 

4657w 2800Z + 1260Z + 462 F 4- 143 W ; 



THE CATTLE-PROBLEM. 321 

and, by means of the values in (a'), OS"), (7'), we derive 
297. 4657w = 2402120 F, 

or 3 8 . 11 . 4657w = 2 8 . 5 . 7 . 23 . 373F (8')- 

Hence, by means of (*;), (f), (e), we have 

3Ml.4657y = 13. 46489 F (e'), 

3 8 .4657s = 2 8 .5.7.761F (f), 

and 3M1. 46570 = 2. 17. 15991 F (17'). 

And, since all the unknowns must be whole numbers, we see 
from the equations (a'), (/8'), (V) that F must be divisible by 
3 4 . 11 . 4657, i.e. we may put 

F = 3M 1 . 4657ft = 4149387*. 

Therefore the equations (a'), (/8%..(V) give the following values 
for all the unknowns in terms of n, viz. 

W = 2 . 3 . 7 . 53 . 4657n = 10366482^ 

X = 2 . 3* . 89 . 4657 n = 746051 4n 

F=3M1. 4657ft = 4149387n

r = 2 2 . 3. 5. 7.11.761?i= 3515820?iJ 

If now n = 1, the numbers are the smallest which will satisfy 
the seven equations (a), 08),... (iy); and we have next to find 
such an integral value for n that the equation (i) will be 
satisfied also. [The modified equation (0) requiring that TF-f X 
must be a product of two factors is then simultaneously 
satisfied.] 

Equation (t) requires that

Putting for F, Z their values as above ascertained, we have 
( + 1 > = (3M1 + 2" . 5 . 79) . 4657w 

= 2471.4657w 
= 7.353.4657w. 

Now q is either even or odd, so that either q = 2s, or 
q-2s-l y and the equation becomes 



As n need not be a prime number, we suppose n = u . v, where 
a is the factor in n which divides s without a remainder and v 
the factor which divides 2s I without a remainder ; we then 
have the following sixteen alternative pairs of simultaneous 
equations :

7.4657v,

*=7.353.4657u, 2sl= 0. 

In order to find the least value of n which satisfies all the 
conditions of the problem, we have to choose from the various 
positive integral solutions of these pairs of equations that 
particular one which gives the smallest value for the product 
uv or n. 

If we solve the various pairs and compare the results, we 
find that it is the pair of equations 

a 7w, 2* - 1 = 353 . 46570, 
which leads to the solution we want ; this solution is then 

w = 117423, 0=1, 
so that n = uv = 1 17423 = 3 8 . 4349, 



THE CATTLE-PROBLEM. 323 

whence it follows that 

7 = 821961, 

and g = 2* - 1 = 1643921. 

Thus F+=2471.4657n

= 1351238949081

which is a triangular number, as required. 

The number in equation (0) which has to be the product of 
two integers is now 

W + X = 2 . 3 . (7 . 53 + 3 . 89) . 4657 
= 2'.3.11.29.4657 
= 2. 3. 11. 29. 4657. 117423 
= 2". 3M 1.29. 4657. 4349 
= (2* . 3 4 . 4349) . (1 1 . 29 . 4657) 
= 1409076.1485583, 
which is a rectangular number with nearly equal factors. 

The solution is then as follows (substituting for n its value 
117423): 

^=1217263415886 

X= 876035935422 

Y= 487233469701 

Z= 864005479380 

w= 846192410280 

x = 574579625058 

y= 638688708099 

z= 412838131860 

and the sum = 5916837175686

The complete problem. 

In this case the seven original equations (a), (),... (?/) have 
to be satisfied, and the following further conditions must hold, 

W H- X = a square number = p 2 , say, 



F + Z = a triangular number = ~ - > say. 

Using the values found above (A), we have in the first place 
p 2 = 2 . 3 . (7 . 53 + 3 . 89) . 4657 

= 2 2 .3.11.29.4657w, 
and this equation will be satisfied if 

n = 3 . 11 . 29 . 4657? 2 = 4456749f \ 
where f is any integer. 

Thus the first 8 equations (a), (/3),...(?), (6) are satisfied by 
the following values : 

F=2.3 2 .7.11.29.53.4657 2 .f = 46200808287018 . "

It remains to determine f so that equation (t) may be 
satisfied, i.e. so that

                2 ? + l = J, 2.4657.f = w, 
                and we have the "Pellian" equation 
                
                $'-1 = 2. 3. 7. 11. 29. 353. <

                Of the solutions of this equation the smallest has to be 
                chosen for which it is divisible by 2 . 4657. 
                
                When this is done,

                whence, by substitution of the value of f so found in the last 
                system of equations, we should arrive at the solution of the 
                complete problem. 
                
                It would require too much space to enter on the solution of 
                the " Pellian " equation 
                
                f- 4729494 * = !, 
                
                and the curious reader is referred to Amthor's paper itself. 
                Suffice it to say that he develops V47 29494 in the form of a 
                continued fraction as far as the period which occurs after 91 
                convergents, and, after an arduous piece of work, arrives at the 
                conclusion that

                digits to follow, and that, with the same notation, 
                
                the whole number of cattle = 7766 <2Q6543>. 
                
                One may well be excused for doubting whether Archimedes 
                solved the complete problem, having regard to the enormous

                work. By way of giving an idea of the space which would be 
                required for merely writing down the results when obtained, 
                Amthor remarks that the large seven-figured logarithmic tables 
                contain on one page 50 lines with 50 figures or so in each, say 
                altogether 2500 figures ; therefore one of the eight unknown 
                quantities would, when found, occupy 82 such pages, and to 
                write down all the eight numbers would require a volume of 
                660 pages!]
