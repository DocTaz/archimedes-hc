"I POSTULATE the following: 

1. Equal weights at equal distances are in equilibrium, 
and equal weights at unequal distances are not in equilibrium 
but incline towards the weight which is at the greater distance. 

2. If, when weights at certain distances are in equilibrium, 
something be added to one of the weights, they are not in 
equilibrium but incline towards that weight to which the 
addition was made. 

3. Similarly, if anything be taken away from one of the 
weights, they are not in equilibrium but incline towards the 
weight from which nothing was taken. 

4. When equal and similar plane figures coincide if applied 
to one another, their centres of gravity similarly coincide. 

5. In figures which are unequal but similar the centres of 
gravity will be similarly situated. By points similarly situated 
in relation to similar figures I mean points such that, if straight 
lines be drawn from them to the equal angles, they make equal 
angles with the corresponding sides.

6. If magnitudes at certain distances be in equilibrium, 
(other) magnitudes equal to them will also be in equilibrium at 
the same distances. 

7. In any figure whose perimeter is concave in (one and) 
the same direction the centre of gravity must be within the 
figure." 

Proposition 1. 

Weights which balance at equal distances are equal. 

For, if they are unequal, take away from the greater the 
difference between the two. The remainders will then not 
balance [Post. 3] ; which is absurd. 

Therefore the weights cannot be unequal. 

Proposition 2. 

Unequal weights at equal distances will not balance but will 
incline towards the greater weight. 

For take away from the greater the difference between the 
two. The equal remainders will therefore balance [Post. 1]. 
Hence, if we add the difference again, the weights will not 
balance but incline towards the greater [Post. 2], 

Proposition 3. 

Unequal weights will balance at unequal distances, the greater 
weight being at the lesser distance. 

Let A y B be two unequal weights (of which A is the 
greater) balancing about C at distances AC, BG respectively. 




Then shall AC be less than BG. For, if not, take away 
from A the weight (A - B.) The remainders will then incline 



ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF PLANES. I. 191 

towards B [Post. 3]. But this is impossible, for (1) if AC= CB, 
the equal remainders will balance, or (2) if AC>CB, they will 
incline towards A at the greater distance [Post. 1], 

Hence AC<CB. 

Conversely, if the weights balance, and AG< CB, then 
A>B. 



Proposition 4. 

If two equal weights have not the same centre of gravity, the 
centre of gravity of both taken together is at the middle point of 
the line joining their centres of gravity. 

[Proved from Prop. 3 by reductio ad absurdum. Archimedes 
assumes that the centre of gravity of both together is on the 
straight line joining the centres of gravity of each, saying that 
this had been proved before (irpoSeSei/cTai). The allusion is no 
doubt to the lost treatise On levers (irepl 



Proposition 5. 

If three equal magnitudes have their centres of gravity on a 
straight line at equal distances, the centre of gravity of the 
system will coincide with that of the middle magnitude. 

[This follows immediately from Prop. 4.] 

COR 1. The same is true of any odd number of magnitudes 
if those which are at equal distances from the middle one are 
equal, while the distances between their centres of gravity are 
equal. 

COR. 2. If there be an even number of magnitudes with 
their centres of gravity situated at equal distances on one straight 
line, and if the two middle ones be equal, while those which are 
equidistant from them (on each side) are equal respectively, the 
centre of gravity of the system is the middle point of the line 
joining the centres of gravity of the two middle ones.

Propositions 6, 7. 

Two magnitudes, whether commensurable [Prop. 6] or in- 
commensurable [Prop. 7], balance at distances reciprocally 
proportional to the magnitudes. 

I. Suppose the magnitudes A, B to be commensurable, 
and the points A, B to be their centres of gravity. Let DE be 
a straight line so divided at that 

A :B = DC:CE. 

We have then to prove that, if A be placed at E and B at 
D, C is the centre of gravity of the two taken together. 





Since A, B are commensurable, so are DC, CE. Let N be 
a common measure of DC, CE. Make DH, DK each equal to 
CE, and EL (on CE produced) equal to CD. Then EH= CD, 
since DH = CE. Therefore LH is bisected at E, as HK is 
bisected at D. 

Thus LH, HK must each contain N an even number of 
times. 

Take a magnitude such that is contained as many 
times in A as N is contained in LH, whence 

A :0 = LH :N. 

But B : A = CE : DC 

= HK:LH. 

Hence, ex aequali, B : = HK : N, or is contained in B as 
many times as N is contained in HK. 

Thus is a common measure of A t B. 



ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF PLANES I. 



193 



Divide LH> HK into parts each equal to N, and A, B into 
parts each equal to 0. The parts of A will therefore be equal 
in number to those of LH, and the parts of B equal in number 
to those of HK. Place one of the parts of A at the middle 
point of each of the parts N of LH, and one of the parts of B 
at the middle point of each of the parts N of HK. 

Then the centre of gravity of the parts of A placed at equal 
distances on LH will be at E, the middle point of LH [Prop. 5, 
Cor. 2], and the centre of gravity of the parts of B placed at 
equal distances along HK will be at Z), the middle point of HK. 

Thus we may suppose A itself applied at E, and B itself 
applied at D. 

But the system formed by the parts of A and B together 
is a system of equal magnitudes even in number and placed at 
equal distances along LK . And, since LE = CD, and EC = DK t 
LC= CK, so that C is the middle point of LK. Therefore C is 
the centre of gravity of the system ranged along LK. 

Therefore A acting at E and B acting at D balance about 
the point C. 

II. Suppose the magnitudes to be incommensurable, and 
let them be (A + a) and B respectively. Let DE be a line 
divided at C so that 

: CE. 





Then, if (A + a) placed at E and B placed at D do not 
balance about 0, (A + a) is either too great to balance B, or not 
great enough. 

Suppose, if possible, that (A +a) is too great to balance B. 
Take from ( A + a) a magnitude a smaller than the deduction 
which would make the remainder balance B, but such that the 
remainder A and the magnitude B are commensurable. 

H. A. 13 



194 ARCHIMEDES 

Then, since A, B are commensurable, and 

A :B<DC: CE, 
A and B will not balance [Prop. 6], but D will be depressed. 

But this is impossible, since the deduction a was an 
insufficient deduction from (A + a) to produce equilibrium, so 
that E was still depressed. 

Therefore (A + a) is not too great to balance B ; and 
similarly it may be proved that B is not too great to balance 
(A + a). 

Hence ( A + a), B taken together have their centre of 
gravity at C. 

Proposition 8. 

If AB be a magnitude whose centre of gravity is C, and AD 
a part of it whose centre of gravity is F, then the centre of 
gravity of the remaining part will be a point G on FG produced 
such that 

GG : CF=(AD):(DE). 



For, if the centre of gravity of the remainder (DE) be not 
G, let it be a point JET. Then an absurdity follows at once from 
Props. 6, 7. 

Proposition 9. 

The centre of gravity of any parallelogram lies on the 
straight line joining the middle points of opposite sides. 

Let ABCD be a parallelogram, and let EF join the middle 
points of the opposite sides AD, BC. 

If the centre of gravity does not lie on EF, suppose it to be 
H, and draw HK parallel to AD or BC meeting EF in K. 



ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF PLANES I. 195 

Then it is possible, by bisecting ED, then bisecting the 
halves, and so on continually, to arrive at a length EL less 




than KH. Divide both AE and ED into parts each equal 
to EL y and through the points of division draw parallels to AB 
or CD. 

We have then a number of equal and similar parallelograms, 
and, if any one be applied to any other, their centres of gravity 
coincide [Post. 4], Thus we have an even number of equal 
magnitudes whose centres of gravity lie at equal distances along 
a straight line. Hence the centre of gravity of the whole 
parallelogram will lie on the line joining the centres of gravity 
of the two middle parallelograms [Prop. 5, Cor. 2]. 

But this is impossible, for H is outside the middle 
parallelograms. 

Therefore the centre of gravity cannot but lie on EF. 



Proposition 1O. 

The centre of gravity of a parallelogram is the point of 
intersection of its diagonals. 

For, by the last proposition, the centre of gravity lies on 
each of the lines which bisect opposite sides. Therefore it 
is at the point of their intersection; and this is also the 
point of intersection of the diagonals. 

Alternative proof. 

Let ABCD be the given parallelogram, and BD a diagonal. 
Then the triangles ABD y CDB are equal and similar, so that 
[Post. 4], if one be applied to the other, their centres of gravity 
will fall one upon the other.

196 



ARCHIMEDES 




Suppose jPto be the centre of gravity of the triangle ABD. 
Let G be the middle point of BD. 
Join FG and produce it to H, so 
that FG = GH. 

If we then apply the triangle 
ABD to the triangle CDS so that 
AD falls on CB and AB on CD, the 
point F will fall on H. 

But [by Post. 4] F will fall on the centre of gravity of 
CDB. Therefore H is the centre of gravity of CDS. 

Hence, since F, H are the centres of gravity of the two 
equal triangles, the centre of gravity of the whole parallelogram 
is at the middle point of FH, i.e. at the middle point of BD, 
which is the intersection of the two diagonals. 



Proposition 11. 

If abc, ABC be two similar triangles, and g, G two points in 
them similarly situated with respect to them respectively, then, if 
g be the centre of gravity of the triangle abc, G must be the centre 
of gravity of the triangle ABC. 

Suppose ah : be : ca = AB : BC : CA. 





The proposition is proved by an obvious reductio ad 
absurdum. For, if G be not the centre of gravity of the 
triangle ABC, suppose H to be its centre of gravity. 

Post. 5 requires that g, H shall be similarly situated with 
respect to the triangles respectively; and this leads at once 
to the absurdity that the angles HAS, GAB are equal. 



ON THE BQUILIBBIUM OF PLANES I. 197 

Proposition 12. 

Given two similar triangles abc, ABC, and d, D the middle 
points of be, BG respectively, then, if the centre of gravity of abc 
lie on ad y that of ABC will lie on AD. 

Let g be the point on ad which is the centre of gravity 
of abc. 





b d c B D c 

Take G on AD such that 

ad :ag = AD : AG, 
and join gb, gc, GB, GO. 

Then, since the triangles are similar, and bd, BD are the 
halves of be, BC respectively, 

ab:bd = AB:BD, 
and the angles abd, ABD are equal. 

Therefore the triangles abd, ABD are similar, and 

Z bad = / BAD. 

Also ba:ad = BA : AD, 

while, from above, ad : ag = AD : AG. 

Therefore ba:ag = BA : AG, while the angles bag, BAG 
are equal. 

Hence the triangles bag, BAG are similar, and 



And, since the angles abd, ABD are equal, it follows that 

^gbd = ^GBD. 
In exactly the same manner we prove that 



198 ARCHIMEDES 

Therefore g, G are similarly situated with respect to the 
triangles respectively; whence [Prop. 11] G is the centre of 
gravity of ABC. 



Proposition 13. 

In any triangle the centre of gravity lies on the straight line 
joining any angle to the middle point of the opposite side. 

Let ABC be a triangle and D the middle point of BC. 
Join AD. Then shall the centre of gravity lie on AD. 

For, if possible, let this not be the case, and let H be the 
centre of gravity. Draw HI parallel to CB meeting AD in /. 

Then, if we bisect DC, then bisect the halves, and so on, 
we shall at length arrive at a length, as DE, less than HI. 




Divide both BD and DC into lengths each equal to DE, and 
through the points of division draw lines each parallel to DA 
meeting BA and AC in points as K, L, M and JBT, P, Q 
respectively. 

Join MN, LP, KQ, which lines will then be each parallel 
to BC. 

We have now a series of parallelograms as FQ, TP, SN, 
and AD bisects opposite sides in each. Thus the centre 
of gravity of each parallelogram lies on AD [Prop. 9], and 
therefore the centre of gravity of the figure made up of them 
all lies on AD. 



ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF PLANES I. 199 

Let the centre of gravity of all the parallelograms taken 
together be 0. Join OH and produce it; also draw GV 
parallel to DA meeting OH produced in V. 

Now, if n be the number of parts into which AC is divided, 
&ADC : (sum of triangles on AN, NP, ...) 



= n 2 : n 
= ra: 1 

= AC:AN. 
Similarly 

A ABU : (sum of triangles on AM, ML, ...) = AB : AM. 
And AC:AN = AB:AM. 

It follows that 

A ABC : (sum of all the small As) = CA : AN 

>VO: OH, by parallels. 
Suppose V produced to X so that 

A ABC: (sum of small As) = XO : OH, 
whence, dividendo, 

(sum of parallelograms) : (sum of small As) = Xff : HO. 

Since then the centre of gravity of the triangle ABC is at H, 
and the centre of gravity of the part of it made up of the 
parallelograms is at 0, it follows from Prop. 8 that the centre 
of gravity of the remaining portion consisting of all the small 
triangles taken together is at X. 

But this is impossible, since all the triangles are on one side 
of the line through X parallel to AD. 

Therefore the centre of gravity of the triangle cannot but 
lie on AD. 

Alternative proof. 

Suppose, if possible, that H, not lying on AD, is the centre 
of gravity of the triangle ABC. Join AH, BH, CH. Let 
E, F be the middle points of CA, AB respectively, and join 
DE, EF, FD. Let EF meet AD in M. 



200 ARCHIMEDES 

Draw FK, EL parallel to AH meeting BH, CH in K, L 
respectively. Join KD, HD, LD, KL. Let KL meet DH in 
N, and join MN. 




B D C 

Since DE is parallel to AB, the triangles ABC, EDO are 
similar. 

And, since CE=EA, and EL is parallel to AH, it follows 
that CL = LH. And CD = DB. Therefore BH is parallel 



Thus in the similar and similarly situated triangles ABC, 
EDO the straight lines AH, BH are respectively parallel to 
EL, DL ; and it follows that H, L are similarly situated with 
respect to the triangles respectively. 

But H is, by hypothesis, the centre of gravity of ABO. 
Therefore L is the centre of gravity of EDC. [Prop. 11] 

Similarly the point K is the centre of gravity of the 
triangle FED. 

And the triangles FBD, EDC are equal, so that the centre 
of gravity of both together is at the middle point of KL, i.e. at 
the point N. 

The remainder of the triangle ABC, after the triangles FBD, 
EDC are deducted, is the parallelogram AFDE, and the centre 
of gravity of this parallelogram is at M 9 the intersection of its 
diagonals. 

It follows that the centre of gravity of the whole triangle 
ABC must lie on MN\ that is, MN must pass through H, which 
is impossible (since MN is parallel to AH). 

Therefore the centre of gravity of the triangle ABC cannot 
but lie on AD. 



ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF PLANES I. 201 

Proposition 14. 

It follows at once from the last proposition that the centre 
of gravity of any triangle is at the intersection of the lines drawn 
from any two angles to the middle points of the opposite sides 
respectively. 

Proposition 15. 

If AD, BG be the two parallel sides of a trapezium ABCD, 
AD being the smaller, and if AD, BG be bisected at E, F 
respectively, then the centre of gravity of the trapezium is at a 
point G on EF such that 

GE : GF=(2BC + AD) : (2AD + BC). 
Produce BA, CD to meet at 0. Then FE produced will 
also pass through 0, since AE = ED, and BF = FG. 




Now the centre of gravity of the triangle OAD will lie on 
OE, and that of the triangle OBG will lie on OF. [Prop. 13] 

It follows that the centre of gravity of the remainder, the 
trapezium A BCD, will also lie on OF. [Prop. 8] 

Join BD, and divide it at L y M into three equal parts. 
Through L 9 M draw PQ, R8 parallel to BC meeting BA in 
P, R, FE in W, V, and CD in Q, S respectively. 

Join DF> BE meeting PQ in H and RS in K respectively. 
Now, since BL = BD, 



202 ARCHIMEDES. 

Therefore H is the centre of gravity of the triangle DBC*. 

Similarly, since EK = J BE, it follows that K is the centre 
of gravity of the triangle ADB. 

Therefore the centre of gravity of the triangles DBG, ADB 
together, i.e. of the trapezium, lies on the line HK. 
But it also lies on OF. 

Therefore, if OF, HK meet in G, G is the centre of gravity 
of the trapezium. 

Hence [Props. 6, 7] 

= VG:GW. 

But A DBC : A ABD = BC : AD. 

Therefore BC:AD = VG:G W. 

It follows that 

(2J3<7+ AD) -.(ZAD + Bfy^CZVG + GW) : (2GW + VG) 

= EG:GF.

Proposition 1. 

If P y P' be two parabolic segments and D, E their centres 
of gravity respectively, the centre of gravity of the two segments 
taken together will be at a point C on DE determined by the 
relation 

P:P' = CE:CD*. 

In the same straight line with DE measure EH, EL each 
equal to DC, and DK equal to DH\ whence it follows at once 
that DK = CE, and also that KC= CL 




* This proposition is really a particular case of Props. 6, 7 of Book I. and 
is therefore hardly necessary. As, however, Book II. relates exclusively to 
parabolic segments, Archimedes' object was perhaps to emphasize the fact 
that the magnitudes in I. 6, 7 might be parabolic segments as well as 
rectilinear figures. His procedure is to substitute for the segments rect- 
angles of equal area, a substitution which is rendered possible by the results 
obtained in his separate treatise on the Quadrature of the Parabola,. 



204 ARCHIMEDES 

Apply a rectangle MN equal in area to the parabolic 
segment P to a base equal to KH, and place the rectangle so 
that KH bisects it, and is parallel to its base. 

Then D is the centre of gravity of MN, since KD = DH. 

Produce the sides of the rectangle which are parallel to KH, 
and complete the rectangle NO whose base is equal to HL. 
Then E is the centre of gravity of the rectangle NO. 

Now (MN) : (NO) = KH : HL 

= DH:EH 



= P:P'. 

But (MN) = P. 

Therefore (NO) = P'. 

Also, since C is the middle point of KL, C is the centre 
of gravity of the whole parallelogram made up of the two 
parallelograms (MN), (NO), which are equal to, and have the 
same centres of gravity as, P, P' respectively. 

Hence C is the centre of gravity of P, P' taken together. 



Definition and lemmas preliminary to Proposition 2. 

" If in a segment bounded by a straight line and a section 
of a right-angled cone [a parabola] a triangle be inscribed 
having the same base as the segment and equal height, if again 
triangles be inscribed in the remaining segments having the 
same bases as the segments and equal height, and if in the 
remaining segments triangles be inscribed in the same manner, 
let the resulting figure be said to be inscribed in the 
recognised manner (yiw/u/A'"? eyypdfaaQcu) in the segment. 

And it is plain 

(1) that the lines joining the two angles of the figure so inscribed 
which are nearest to the vertex of the segment t and the next 



ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF PLANES II. 205 

pairs of angles in order, will be parallel to the base of the 
segment, 

(2) that the said lines will be bisected by the diameter of the 
segment, and 

(3) that they will cut the diameter in the proportions of the 
successive odd numbers, the number one having reference to [the 
length adjacent to] the vertex of the segment. 

And these properties will have to be proved in their proper 
places (iv rals rd^eaiv)" 

[The last words indicate an intention to give these pro- 
positions in their proper connexion with systematic proofs ; but 
the intention does not appear to have been carried out, or at 
least we know of no lost work of Archimedes in which they 
could have appeared. The results can however be easily 
derived from propositions given in the Quadrature of the 
Parabola as follows. 

(1) Let BRQPApqrb be a figure inscribed ' in the recog- 
nised manner* in the parabolic segment BAb of which Bb is 
the base, A the vertex and AO the diameter. 




Bisect each of the lines BQ, BA, QA, Aq, Ab, qb, and 
through the middle points draw lines parallel to AO meeting 
Bb in 0, F, E, e,f, g respectively. 



206 ARCHIMEDES 

These lines will then pass through the vertices R, Q, P, 
p, q, r of the respective parabolic segments [Quadrature of the 
Parabola, Prop. 18], i.e. through the angular points of the 
inscribed figure (since the triangles and segments are of equal 
height). 

Also BG = GF=FJE=EO, and Oe = ef=fg = gb. But 
BO = Ob, and therefore all the parts into which Bb is divided 
are equal. 

If now AS, RG meet in Z, and Ab, rg in l y we have 
BG : GL = BO : OA, by parallels, 
= 60:04 

= bg : gl, 
whence GL = gl, 

Again [ibid., Prop. 4] 

= BO: OG 



and, since GL = gl, LR = Ir. 

Therefore GR, gr are equal as well as parallel. 

Hence GRrg is a parallelogram, and Rr is parallel to Bb. 

Similarly it may be shown that Pp, Qq are each parallel 
to Bb. 

(2) Since RGgr is a parallelogram, and RG, rg are 
parallel to AO, while G00g t it follows that Rr is bisected 
by AO. 

And similarly for Pp, Qq. 

(3) Lastly, if F, W, X be the points of bisection of Pp, 



AV:AW:AX:AO = PV*: QF 2 : RX* : BO* 

= 1 : 4 : 9 : 16, 
whence AV : VW : WX : X0 = 1 : 3 : 5 : 7.] 



ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OP PLANES II. 207 

Proposition 2. 

If a figure be 'inscribed in the recognised manner 9 in a 
parabolic segment, the centre of gravity of the figure so inscribed 
will lie on the diameter of the segment. 

For, in the figure of the foregoing lemmas, the centre of 
gravity of the trapezium BRrb must lie on XO, that of the 
trapezium RQqr on WX, and so on, while the centre of gravity 
of the triangle PAp lies on A V. 

Hence the centre of gravity of the whole figure lies on AO. 

Proposition 3. 

If BAB', bab f be two similar parabolic segments whose 
diameters are AO, ao respectively, and if a figure be inscribed 
in each segment ' in the recognised manner,' the number of sides 
in each figure being equal, the centres of gravity of the inscribed 
figures will divide AO, ao in the same ratio. 

[Archimedes enunciates this proposition as true of similar 
segments, but it is equally true of segments which are not 
similar, as the course of the proof will show.] 

Suppose BRQPAP'Q'R'B', brqpap'q'r'b' to be the two 
figures inscribed 'in the recognised manner/ Join PP', QQ', 
RR' meeting AO in L, M, N, and pp', qq', rr' meeting ao 
in I, m, n. 

Then [Lemma (3)] 

AL :LM:MN:NO 
=1:3:5:7 
= al : Im : mn : no, 
so that A 0, ao are divided in the same proportion. 

Also, by reversing the proof of Lemma (3), we see that 

PP' :pp' = QQ' : qq' = RR' : rr' = BB' : bb'. 
Since then RR' : BB' = rr' : bb', and these ratios respec- 
tively determine the proportion in which NO, no are divided 



208 



ARCHIMEDES 



by the centres of gravity of the trapezia BRRB f , brr'V [i. 15], 
it follows that the centres of gravity of the trapezia divide NO, 
no in the same ratio. 




Similarly the centres of gravity of the trapezia RQQ'R', 
rqq'r' divide MN, mn in the same ratio respectively, and so on. 

Lastly, the centres of gravity of the triangles PAP', pap' 
divide AL, al respectively in the same ratio. 

Moreover the corresponding trapezia and triangles are, each 
to each, in the same proportion (since their sides and heights 
are respectively proportional), while AO, ao are divided in 
the same proportion. 

Therefore the centres of gravity of the complete inscribed 
figures divide AO, ao in the same proportion. 

Proposition 4. 

The centre of gravity of any parabolic segment cut off by a 
straight line lies on the diameter of the segment. 

Let BAB 1 be a parabolic segment, A its vertex and AO its 
diameter. 

Then, if the centre of gravity of the segment does not lie on 
AO, suppose it to be, if possible, the point F. Draw FE 
parallel to AO meeting BB' in E. 



ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF PLANES II. 209 

Inscribe in the segment the triangle ABB' having the same 
vertex and height as the segment, and take an area S such 
that 





We can then inscribe in the segment 'in the recognised 
' manner ' a figure such that the segments of the parabola left 
over are together less than 8. [For Prop. 20 of the Quadrature 
of the Parabola proves that, if in any segment the triangle with 
the same base and height be inscribed, the triangle is greater 
than half the segment ; whence it appears that, each time that 
we increase the number of the sides of the figure inscribed ' in 
the recognised manner/ we take away more than half of the 
remaining segments.] 

Let the inscribed figure be drawn accordingly; its centre 
of gravity then lies on A [Prop. 2]. Let it be the point H. 

Join HF and produce it to meet in K the line through B 
parallel to AO. 
Then we have 

(inscribed figure) : (remainder of segmt.) > &ABB' : 8 

>BE:EO 
>KF:FH. 

Suppose L taken on HK produced so that the former ratio is 
equal to the ratio LF : FH. 

H. A. 14 



210 ARCHIMEDES 

Then, since H is the centre of gravity of the inscribed 
figure, and F that of the segment, L must be the centre 
of gravity of all the segments taken together which form the 
remainder of the original segment. [I. 8] 

But this is impossible, since all these segments lie on one 
side of the line drawn through L parallel to AO [Cf. Post. 7]. 

Hence the centre of gravity of the segment cannot but lie 
on AO. 

Proposition 5. 

If in a parabolic segment a figure be inscribed ( in the 
recognised manner' the centre of gravity of the segment is nearer 
to the vertex of the segment than the centre of gravity of the 
inscribed figure is. 

Let BAB' be the given segment, and AO its diameter. 
First, let ABB' be the triangle in- 
scribed 'in the recognised manner.' 

Divide AO in F so that AF= 2FO ; 
F is then the centre of gravity of the 
triangle ABB'. 

Bisect AB } AB' in D, D' respec- 
tively, and join DD' meeting AO in E. 
Draw DQ y D'Q' parallel to OA to meet 
the curve. QD, Q'D' will then be the 
diameters of the segments whose bases 
are A B> AB\ and the centres of gravity 
of those segments will lie respectively 
on QD, Q'D' [Prop. 4]. Let them be H, H' y and join HH' 
meeting AO in K. 

Now QD, Q'D' are equal*, and therefore the segments of 
which they are the diameters are equal [On Conoids and 
Spheroids, Prop. 3]. 

* This may either be inferred from Lemma (1) above (since QQ', DD' are 
both parallel to J3J3'), or from Prop. 19 of the Quadrature of the Parabola, which 
applies equally to Q or Q f . 




ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF PLANES II. 211 

Also, since QD, Q'D' are parallel*, and DE = ED', K is the 
middle point of HH'. 

Hence the centre of gravity of the equal segments AQB, 
AQ'B' taken together is K, where K lies between E and A. 
And the centre of gravity of the triangle ABB' is F. 

It follows that the centre of gravity of the whole segment 
BAB' lies between K and F, and is therefore nearer to the 
vertex A than F is. 

Secondly, take the five-sided figure BQAQ'B' inscribed 'in 
the recognised manner/ QD, Q'D' being, as before, the diameters 
of the segments AQB, AQ'B'. 

Then, by the first part of this proposition, the centre of 
gravity of the segment AQB (lying of course on QD) is nearer 
to Q than the centre of gravity of the triangle AQB is. Let 
the centre of gravity of the segment be H, and that of the 
triangle /. 

Similarly let H' be the centre of gravity of the segment 
AQ'B', and I' that of the triangle AQ'B'. 

It follows that the centre of gravity 
of the two segments AQB, AQ'B' taken 
together is K, the middle point of HH', 
and that of the two triangles AQB, AQ'B' 
is L, the middle point of II'. 

If now the centre of gravity of the 
triangle ABB f be F, the centre of gravity 
of the whole segment BAB' (i.e. that of 
the triangle ABB' and the two segments 
AQB, AQ'B' taken together) is a point 
Q on KF determined by the proportion 

(sum of segments AQB, AQ'B') : A ABB' = FG : QK. [I. 6, 7] 

* There is clearly some interpolation in the text here, which has the words 
Kal eircl irapa\\ri\6ypa^6v lari rb GZHI. It is not jet proved that H'D'DH is 
a parallelogram ; this can only be inferred from the fact that H, H' divide QD, 
Q'D' respectively in the same ratio. But this latter property does not appear 
till Prop. 7, and is then only enunciated of similar segments. The interpolation 
must have been made before Eutociua' time, because he has a note on the 
phrase, and explains it by gravely assuming that H, H' divide QD, Q'D' respec- 
tively in the same ratio.

212 ARCHIMEDES 

And the centre of gravity of the inscribed figure BQAQ'B' 
is a point F' on LF determined by the proportion 

(&AQB + AAQ'B') : &ABB' = FF' : F'L. [I. 6, 7] 
[Hence FG:GK> FF' : FL, 

or GK:FG<F'l:FF', 

and, componendo, FK :FG<FL: FF', while FK> FL.] 
Therefore FG > FF', or G lies nearer than F' to the vertex A. 

Using this last result, and proceeding in the same way, 
we can prove the proposition for any figure inscribed ' in the 
recognised manner/ 

Proposition 6. 

Given a segment of a parabola cut off by a straight line, it is 
possible to inscribe in it ' in the recognised manner' a figure such 
that the distance between the centres of gravity of the segment and 
of the inscribed figure is less than any assigned length. 

Let BAB' be the segment, AO its diameter, G its centre 
of gravity, and ABB' the triangle inscribed ' in the recognised 
manner. 1 

Let D be the assigned length and 8 an area such that 
AG:D = &ABB' : S. 

In the segment inscribe ' in the recognised manner ' a figure 
such that the sum of the segments left over is less than 8. 
Let F be the centre of gravity of the inscribed figure. 

We shall prove that FG < D. 

For, if not, FG must be either equal to, or greater than, D. 

And clearly 

(inscribed fig.) : (sum of remaining segmts.) 



>AG:D 

>AG: FG, by hypothesis (since FG { D). 



ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF PLANES II. 213 

Let the first ratio be equal to the ratio KG : FG (where K 
lies on GA produced); and it follows that K is the centre of 
gravity of the small segments taken together. [I. 8] 




But this is impossible, since the segments are all on the 
same side of a line drawn through K parallel to BB'. 

Hence FG cannot but be less than D. 



Proposition 7. 

If there be two similar parabolic segments, their centres of 
gravity divide their diameters in the same ratio. 

[This proposition, though enunciated of similar segments 
only, like Prop. 3 on which it depends, is equally true of 
any segments. This fact did not escape Archimedes, who 
uses the proposition in its more general form for the proof of 
Prop. 8 immediately following.] 

Let BAB', bob' be the two similar segments, AO, ao their 
diameters, and G, g their centres of gravity respectively. 

Then, if G, g do not divide AO, ao respectively in the same 
ratio, suppose H to be such a point on AO that 



214 



ARCHIMEDES 



and inscribe in the segment BAB' ' in the recognised manner ' 
a figure such that, if F be its centre of gravity, 

GF<QH. [Prop. 6] 





Inscribe in the segment bab' ' in the recognised manner ' a 
similar figure; then, if/ be the centre of gravity of this figure, 

ag < of. [Prop. 5] 

And, by Prop. 3, af:fo = AF: FO. 
But AF:FO<AH:HO 

< ag : go, by hypothesis. 

Therefore af:fo<ag : go ; which is impossible. 

It follows that G, g cannot but divide AO, ao in the same 
ratio. 

Proposition 8. 

If AO be the diameter of a parabolic segment, and G its 
centre of gravity, then 



Let the segment be BAB'. Inscribe the triangle ABB' 'in 
the recognised manner/ and let F be its centre of gravity. 

Bisect AB t AB' in D, D', and draw DQ t D'Q' parallel to OA 
to meet the curve, so that QD, Q'D' are the diameters of the 
segments AQB, AQ'B' respectively. 

Let H, H' be the centres of gravity of the segments AQB, 
AQ'B' respectively. Join QQ', HH' meeting AO in F, K 
respectively. 




ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF PLANES II. 215 

K is then the centre of gravity of the two segments AQB, 
AQB' taken together. B 

Now AG:GO = QH:HD, ^ 

[Prop. 7] 
whence AO : OG = QD : HD. 

But AO = 4tQD [as is easily proved 
by means of Lemma (3), p. 206]. 

Therefore G = 4tHD ; 

and, by subtraction, AG = 4QH. 

Also, by Lemma (2), QQ' is paral- 
lel to BB' and therefore to DD'. It 
follows from Prop. 7 that HE' is also parallel to QQ' or DD', 

and hence QH=VK. 

Therefore 
and 
Measuring VL along VK so that VL = A V, we have 

KG = 3LK (1). 

Again A = 4 A V [Lemma (3)] 

= 3AL, since AV=3VL, 

whence AL J A0= OF (2). 

Now, by I. 6, 7, 

&ABB' : (sum of segmts. AQB, AQ'B') = KG : GF, 
and &ABB' = 3 (sum of segments AQB, AQ'B') 

[since the segment ABB' is equal to f A ABB' (Quadrature of 
the Parabola, Props. 17, 24)]. 

Hence KG = SGF. 

But KG = 3LK, from (1) above. 

Therefore LF= LK+KG + GF 



216 ARCHIMEDES 

And, from (2), 



Therefore OF= 5GF, 

and OG = 6GF. 

But AO = 30F=15GF. 

Therefore, by subtraction,

Archimedes exhibits his lines in the figure 
reproduced in the margin, but, now that it is

no advantage in using the figure and the more 
cumbrous notation which only obscures the course

Proposition 1O. 

7/ 1 PPB'B be the portion of a parabola intercepted between 
two parallel chords PP, BB' bisected respectively in N, by 
the diameter ANO (N being nearer than to A, the vertex 
of the segments), and if NO be divided into five equal parts of 
which LM is the middle one (L being nearer than M to JV), then, 
if G be a point on LM such that 

LG : GM=BO*.(1PN + BO) : PN*.(2BO + PN\ 
G will be the centre of gravity of the area PP'B'B. 

Take a line ao equal to -40, and an on it equal to AN. Let 
p, q be points on the line ao such that 

ao : aq = aq : an ..................... (1), 

ao : an = aq : ap ..................... (2), 

[whence ao : aq = aq : an = an : ap, or ao, aq, an, ap are lines in 
continued proportion and in descending order of magnitude]. 
Measure along GA a length GF such that 

op:ap = OL: GF ..................... (3). 



ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF PLANES II. 219 

Then, since PN, BO are ordinates to ANO, 



= ao : an 

= tt0 2 :a ? *, by(l), 

so that BO :PN=ao : aq (4), 

and 50 s : PN 8 = ao 3 : aq 3 

= (ao : aq) . (aq : an) . (an : ap) 

(5). 




a p n 



Thus (segment BAB') : (segment PAP') 

= ABAB' : &PAP' 



= ao : ap, 
whence 

(area PP'B'B) : (segment PAP') = op:ap 

= OL : OF, by (3), 
= $ON:GF ......... (6). 

Now 2 . (2PN + BO) : BO 3 = (2PN+BO) : BO 

= (2aq + ao) : ao, by (4), 
BO*:PN* = ao : ap, by (5), 
and PN*:PN*. (2BO + PN) = PN : (2BO + PN) 

= aq : (2ao + aq), by (4), 
= ap:(2an + ap), by (2). 



220 ARCHIMEDES. 

Hence, ex aequali, 

BO* . (2PN + BO):PN>. (ZBO + PN) = (2aq + ao) : (2an + op), 

so that, by hypothesis, 

i(? : GM = (2aq + ao) : (Zan + ap). 
Componendo, and multiplying the antecedents by 5, 

ON : GM- {5 (ao + op) + 10 (aq + an)} : (2an + ap). 
But ON:OM=&:* 

= (5 (ao + ap) + 10 (aq + an)} : {2 (ao 4- ap) + 4t(aq + an)}. 
It follows that 

ON :OG = {5 (ao + ap) + 1 (ag + an)} : (2ao + 4taq + 6an 4- 3ajp). 
Therefore 
(2ao + 4aq + 6an + 3ap) : {5 (ao + ap) + 10 (aq + an)} =* OG : ON 

= 0(? : on. 
And ap : (ao ap) = ap : op 

= GF : OL y by hypothesis, 



while ao, ag, an, ap are in continued proportion. 
Therefore, by Prop. 9, 



Thus F is the centre of gravity of the segment BAB'. [Prop. 8] 

Let H be the centre of gravity of the segment PAP ', so 
that AH = I AN. 

And, since 4.F = f J. 0, 

we have, by subtraction, .ff-F = $ON. 
But, by (6) above, 

(area PP'B'B) : (segment PAP') - f ON : GF 

= HF:FG. 

Thus, since F, H are the centres of gravity of the segments 
BAB', PAP' respectively, it follows [by I. 6, 7] that G is the 
centre of gravity of the area PP'B'B.
