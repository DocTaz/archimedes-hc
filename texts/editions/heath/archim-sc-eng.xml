ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDEE. 

BOOK I. 



" ARCHIMEDES to Dositheus greeting. 

On a former occasion I sent you the investigations which 
I had up to that time completed, including the proofs, showing 
that any segment bounded by a straight line and a section of a 
right-angled cone [a parabola] is four-thirds of the triangle 
which has the same base with the segment and equal height. 
Since then certain theorems not hitherto demonstrated (ai/e- 
\eyicT(ov) have occurred to me, and I have worked out the proofs 
of them. They are these : first, that the surface of any sphere 
is four times its greatest circle (TOV p&yio-rov KVK\OV)\ next, 
that the surface of any segment of a sphere is equal to a circle 
whose radius (rj etc TOV icevrpov) is equal to the straight line 
drawn from the vertex (tcopv<f>ij) of the segment to the circum- 
ference of the circle which is the base of the segment ; and, 
further, that any cylinder having its base equal to the greatest 
circle of those in the sphere, and height equal to the diameter 
of the sphere, is itself [i.e. in content] half as large again as the 
sphere, and its surface also [including its bases] is half as large 
again as the surface of the sphere. Now these properties were 
all along naturally inherent in the figures referred to (avry ry 
<t>v<ri, TrpovTrfipxGv 7Tpl TO, elprj/jbeva o-^/xara), but remained 
unknown to those who were before my time engaged in the 
study of geometry. Having, however, now discovered that the 
properties are true of these figures, I cannot feel any hesitation 

H. A. 1 



2 ARCHIMEDES 

in setting them side by side both with my former investiga- 
tions and with those of the theorems of Eudoxus on solids 
which are held to be most irrefragably established, namely, 
that any pyramid is one third part of the prism which has the 
same base with the pyramid and equal height, and that any 
cone is one third part of the cylinder which has the same 
base with the cone and equal height. For, though these 
properties also were naturally inherent in the figures all along, 
yet they were in fact unknown to all the many able geometers 
who lived before Eudoxus, and had not been observed by any 
one. Now, however, it will be open to those who possess the 
requisite ability to examine these discoveries of mine. They 
ought to have been published while Conon was still alive, 
for I should conceive that he would best have been able to 
grasp them and to pronounce upon them the appropriate 
verdict ; but, as I judge it well to communicate them to those 
who are conversant with mathematics, I send them to you with 
the proofs written out, which it will be open to mathematicians 
to examine. Farewell. 

I first set out the axioms* and the assumptions which I 
have used for the proofs of my propositions. 

DEFINITIONS. 

1. There are in a plane certain terminated bent lines 
(icafji7rv\ai, ypa/ji/j,al TreTrepcuT/jLevai)^, which either lie wholly on 
the same side of the straight lines joining their extremities, or 
have no part of them on the other side. 

2. I apply the term concave in the same direction 

to a line such that, if any two points on it are taken, either 
all the straight lines connecting the points fall on the same 
side of the line, or some fall on one and the same side while 
others fall on the line itself, but none on the other side. 

* Though the word used is dtu/uara, the " axioms" are more of the nature 
of definitions ; and in fact Eutocius in his notes speaks of them as such (tipoi). 

f Under the term bent line Archimedes includes not only curved lines of 
continuous curvature, but lines made up of any number of lines which may be 
either straight or curved. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 3 

3. Similarly also there are certain terminated surfaces, not 
themselves being in a plane but having their extremities in a 
plane, and such that they will either be wholly on the same 
side of the plane containing their extremities, or have no part 
of them on the other side. 

4. I apply the term concave in the same direction 

to surfaces such that, if any two points on them are taken, the 
straight lines connecting the points either all fall on the same 
side of the surface, or some fall on one and the same side of 
it while some fall upon it, but none on the other side. 

5. I use the term solid sector, when a cone cuts a sphere, 
and has its apex at the centre of the sphere, to denote the 
figure comprehended by the surface of the cone and the surface 
of the sphere included within the cone. 

6. I apply the term solid rhombus, when two cones with 
the same base have their apices on opposite sides of the plane 
of the base in such a position that their axes lie in a straight 
line, to denote the solid figure made up of both the cones. 

ASSUMPTIONS. 

1. Of all lines which have the same extremities the straight 
line is the least*. 

* This well-known Archimedean assumption is scarcely, as it stands, a 
definition of a straight line, though Proclus says [p. 110 ed. Friedlein] "Archi- 
medes defined (upla-a.ro} the straight line as the least of those [lines] which have 
the same extremities. For because, as Euclid's definition says, { ftroi; KTCU rots 
t<p (O.VTTJS <n?/xelots, it is in consequence the least of those which have the same 
extremities." Proclus had just before [p. 109] explained Euclid's definition, 
which, as will be seen, is different from the ordinary version given in our text- 
books; a straight line is not " that which lies evenly between its extreme points," 
but "that which e tvov rots i<p eavrfy ffweiot* KCITCU." The words of Proclus 
are, " He [Euclid] shows by means of this that the straight line alone [of all 
lines] occupies a distance (icarlxeci' &d0Ti?/a) equal to that between the points 
on it. For, as far as one of its points is removed from another, so great is the 
length (fjuiytBot) of the straight line of which the points are the extremities; 
and this is the meaning of r6 <? foov jteto-ftu roc; e'0* tavrrjs (rwteloi?. But, if you 
take two points on a circumference or any other line, the distance cut off 
between them along the line is greater than the interval separating them ; and 
this is the case with every line except the straight line." It appears then from 
this that Euclid's definition should be understood in a sense very like that of 

12 



4 ARCHIMEDES 

2. Of other lines in a plane and having the same extremi- 
ties, [any two] such are unequal whenever both are concave in 
the same direction and one of them is either wholly included 
between the other and the straight line which has the same 
extremities with it, or is partly included by, and is partly 
common with, the other; and that [line] which is included is 
the lesser [of the two]. 

3. Similarly, of surfaces which have the same extremities, 
if those extremities are in a plane, the plane is the least [in 
area]. 

4. Of other surfaces with the same extremities, the ex- 
tremities being in a plane, [any two] such are unequal when- 
ever both are concave in the same direction and one surface 
is either wholly included between the other and the plane which 
has the same extremities with it, or is partly included by, and 
partly common with, the other; and that [surface] which is 
included is the lesser [of the two in area]. 

5. Further, of unequal lines, unequal surfaces, and unequal 
solids, the greater exceeds the less by such a magnitude as, 
when added to itself, can be made to exceed any assigned 
magnitude among those which are comparable with [it and 
with] one another*. 

These things being premised, if a polygon be inscribed in a 
circle, it is plain that the perimeter of the inscribed polygon is 
less than the circumference of the circle ; for each of the sides 
of the polygon is less than that part of the circumference of the 
circle which is cut off by it." 

Archimedes* assumption, and we might perhaps translate as follows, (( A straight 
line is that which extends equally (<? t<rov Ketrat) with the points on it," or, to 
follow Proclus' interpretation more closely, "A straight line is that which 
represents equal extension with [the distances separating] the points on it. 1 ' 
* With regard to this assumption compare the Introduction, chapter in. 2. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 



Proposition 1. 

// a polygon be circumscribed about a circle, the perimeter 
of the circumscribed polygon is greater 
than the perimeter of the circle. 

Let any two adjacent sides, meet- 
ing in A, touch the circle at P, Q 
respectively. 

Then [Assumptions, 2] 

PA+AQ>(arcPQ). 
A similar inequality holds for each 
angle of the polygon; and, by ad- 
dition, the required result follows. 




Proposition 2. 

Given two unequal magnitudes, it is possible to find two un- 
equal straight lines such that the greater straight line has to the 
less a ratio less than the greater magnitude has to the less. 

Let AB, D represent the two unequal magnitudes, AB being 
the greater. 

Suppose BO measured along BA equal to D, and let GH be 
any straight line. 

Then, if CA be added to itself a sufficient 
number of times, the sum will exceed D. Let 
AF be this sum, and take E on GH produced 
such that GH is the same multiple of HE that 
AF is of AC. 

Thus EH:HG = AC:AF. 
But, since AF>D (or CB), 

AC :AF<AC :CB. 
Therefore, componendo, 

EG:GH<AB:D. 
Hence EG, GH are two lines satisfying the given condition. 



ARCHIMEDES 



Proposition 3. 

Given two unequal magnitudes and a circle, it is possible to 
inscribe a polygon in the circle and to describe another about it 
so that the side of the circumscribed polygon may have to the side 
of the inscribed polygon a ratio less than that of the greater 
magnitude to the less. 

Let A, B represent the given magnitudes, A being the 
greater. 

Find [Prop. 2] two straight lines F, KL, of which F is the 
greater, such that 

F:KL<A :B (1). 





Draw LM perpendicular to LK and of such length that 



In the given circle let CE, DG be two diameters at right 
angles. Then, bisecting the angle DOC, bisecting the half 
again, and so on, we shall arrive ultimately at an angle (as 
NOG) less than twice the angle LKM. 

Join NC, which (by the construction) will be the side of a 
regular polygon inscribed in the circle. Let OP be the radius 
of the circle bisecting the angle NOG (and therefore bisecting 
NC at right angles, in H, say), and let the tangent at P meet 
0(7, ON produced in S 9 T respectively. 

Now, since CO N < 2 Z LKM, 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 

and the angles at H, L are right ; 

therefore MK:LK>OG: OH 
> OP : OH. 
Hence ST:CN<MK: LK 



therefore, a fortiori, by (1), 

8T:CN<A :B. 
Thus two polygons are found satisfying the given condition. 



Proposition 4. 

Again, given two unequal magnitudes and a sector, it is 
possible to describe a polygon about the sector and to inscribe 
another in it so that the side of the circumscribed polygon may 
have to the side of the inscribed polygon a ratio less than the 
greater magnitude has to the less. 

[The " inscribed polygon " found in this proposition is one 
which has for two sides the two radii bounding the sector, while 
the remaining sides (the number of which is, by construction, 
some power of 2) subtend equal parts of the arc of the sector ; 
the "circumscribed polygon" is formed by the tangents parallel 
to the sides of the inscribed polygon and by the two bounding 
radii produced.] 




In this case we make the same construction as in the last 
proposition except that we bisect the angle COD of the sector, 
instead of the right angle between two diameters, then bisect 
the half again, and so on. The proof is exactly similar to the 
preceding one.

ARCHIMEDES 



Proposition 5. 

Given a circle and two unequal magnitudes, to describe a 
polygon about the circle and inscribe another in it, so that the 
circumscribed polygon may have to the inscribed a ratio less than 
the greater magnitude has to the less. 

Let A be the given circle and B, C the given magnitudes, B 
being the greater. 




o- 

E- 
F- 



Take two unequal straight lines D t E, of which D is the 
greater, such that D : E < B : G [Prop. 2], and let F be a mean 
proportional between D, E, so that D is also greater than F. 

Describe (in the manner of Prop. 3) one polygon about the 
circle, and inscribe another in it, so that the side of the former 
has to the side of the latter a ratio less than the ratio D : F. 

Thus the duplicate ratio of the side of the former polygon 
to the side of the latter is less than the ratio D* : F*. 

But the said duplicate ratio of the sides is equal to the 
ratio of the areas of the polygons, since they are similar ; 

therefore the area of the circumscribed polygon has to the 
area of the inscribed polygon a ratio less than the ratio /)* : F 9 , 
or D : E, and a fortiori less than the ratio B : C. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 



Proposition 6. 

" Similarly we can show that, given two unequal magnitude? 
and a sector, it is possible to circumscribe a polygon about the 
sector and inscribe in it another similar one so that the circum- 
scribed may have to the inscribed a ratio less than the greater 
magnitude has to the less. 

And it is likewise clear that, if a circle or a sector, as well 
as a certain area, be given, it is possible, by inscribing regular 
polygons in the circle or sector, and by continually inscribing 
such in the remaining segments, to leave segments of the circle or 
sector which are [together] less than the given area. For this is 
proved in the Elements [Eucl. xu. 2]. 

But it is yet to be proved that, given a circle or sector and 
an area, it is possible to describe a polygon about the circle or 
sector, siich that the area remaining between the circumference 
and the circumscribed figure is less than the given area" 




The proof for the circle (which, as Archimedes says, can be 
equally applied to a sector) is as follows. 

Let A be the given circle and B the given area. 

Now, there being two unequal magnitudes A + B and A, let 
a polygon (C) be circumscribed about the circle and a polygon 
(/) inscribed in it [as in Prop. 5], so that 

C:I<A+B:A (1). 

The circumscribed polygon (C) shall be that required. 



10 ARCHIMEDES 

For the circle (A) is greater than the inscribed polygon (/). 

Therefore, from (1), a fortiori, 

C:A<A+B :A, 
whence C < A + J5, 

or C-A<B. 

Proposition 7. 

If in an isosceles cone [i.e. a right circular cone] a pyramid 
be inscribed having an equilateral base, the surface of the 
pyramid excluding the base is equal to a triangle having its 
base equal to the perimeter of the base of the pyramid and its 
height equal to the perpendicular drawn from the apex on one 
side of the base. 

Since the sides of the base of the pyramid are equal, it 
follows that the perpendiculars from the apex to all the sides 
of the base are equal ; and the proof of the proposition is 
obvious. 

Proposition 8. 

If a pyramid be circumscribed about an isosceles cone t the 
surface of the pyramid excluding its base is equal to a triangle 
having its base equal to the perimeter of the base of the pyramid 
and its height equal to the side [i.e. a generator] of the cone. 

The base of the pyramid is a polygon circumscribed about 
the circular base of the cone, and the line joining the apex of 
the cone or pyramid to the point of contact of any side of the 
polygon is perpendicular to that side. Also all these perpen- 
diculars, being generators of the cone, are equal ; whence the 
proposition follows immediately. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 11 

Proposition 9. 

If in the circular base of an isosceles cone a chord be placed, 
and from its extremities straight lines be drawn to the apex of 
the cone, the triangle so formed will be less than the portion of 
the surface of the cone intercepted between the lines drawn to the 
apex. 

Let ABC be the circular base of the cone, and its apex. 

Draw a chord AB in the circle, and join OA, OB. Bisect 
the arc ACB in C, and join AC, BC, OC. 

Then A OAC + A OBC > A OAB. 





Let the excess of the sum of the first two triangles over the 
third be equal to the area D. 

Then D is either less than the sum of the segments AEG, 
CFB, or not less. 

I. Let D be not less than the sum of the segments referred 
to. 

We have now two surfaces 

(1) that consisting of the portion OAEC of the surface 
of the cone together with the segment AEG, and 

(2) the triangle OAC] 

and, since the two surfaces have the same extremities (the 
perimeter of the triangle OAC), the former surface is greater 
than the latter, which is included by it [Assumptions, 3 or 4]. 



12 ARCHIMEDES 

Hence (surface OAEC) + (segment AEG) > A OAC. 
Similarly (surface OCFB) + (segment CFB) > A OBC. 

Therefore, since D is not less than the sum of the segments, 
we have, by addition, 

(surface OAECFB) + D > A OA C + A OBC 

> A GAB + D, by hypothesis. 

Taking away the common part D, we have the required 
result. 

II. Let D be less than the sum of the segments A EC, 
CFB. 

If now we bisect the arcs AC, CB, then bisect the halves, 
and so on, we shall ultimately leave segments which are 
together less than D. [Prop. 6] 

Let AGE, EEC, CKF, FLB be those segments, and join 
OE, OF. 

Then, as before, 

(surface OA GE) + (segment AGE) > A OAE 
and (surface OEHG) + (segment EHG) > A OEC. 
Therefore (surface OAGHC) + (segments AGE, EEC) 



> A OA C, a fortiori. 

Similarly for the part of the surface of the cone bounded by 
OC, OB and the arc CFB. 

Hence, by addition, 
(surface OA GEHCKFLB)+ (segments AGE, EEC, CKF, FLB) 



> A OAB + D, by hypothesis. 

But the sum of the segments is less than D, and the re- 
quired result follows. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 



13 



Proposition 1O. 

If in the plane of the circular base of an isosceles cone two 
tangents be drawn to the circle meeting in a point, and the points 
of contact and the point of concourse of the tangents be respectively 
joined to the apex of the cone, the sum of the two triangles 
formed by the joining lines and the two tangents are together 
greater than the included portion of the surface of the cone. 

Let ABC be the circular base of the cone, its apex, AD, 
BD the two tangents to the circle meeting in D. Join OA, 
OB, OD. 

Let EOF be drawn touching the circle at C, the middle 
point of the arc ACB, and therefore parallel to AB. Join 
OE, OF. 

Then ED + DF>EF, 

and, adding AE + FB to each side, 

AD + DB > AE + EF+FB. 

Now OA, OC, OB, being generators of the cone, are equal, 
and they are respectively perpendicular to the tangents at A, 
C,B. 




14 ARCHIMEDES 

It follows that 

A OAD+ A ODB > A OAE+ A OEF+ A OFB. 

Let the area G be equal to the excess of the first sum over 
the second. 

G is then either less, or not less, than the sum of the spaces 
EAHC, FCKB remaining between the circle and the tangents, 
which sum we will call L. 

I. Let G be not less than L. 
We have now two surfaces 

(1) that of the pyramid with apex and base AEFB t 
excluding the face OAB, 

(2) that consisting of the part OACB of the surface of the 
cone together with the segment ACB. 

These two surfaces have the same extremities, viz. the 
perimeter of the triangle OAB, and, since the former includes 
the latter, the former is the greater [Assumptions, 4]. 

That is, the surface of the pyramid exclusive of the face 
OAB is greater than the sum of the surface OACB and the 
segment ACB. 

Taking away the segment from each sum, we have 
A OAE + A OEF+ A OFB + L > the surface OAHCKB. 
And G is not less than L. 
It follows that 

A OAE + A OEF+ A OFB + G, 

which is by hypothesis equal to A OAD + A ODB, is greater 
than the same surface. 

II. Let G be less than L. 

If we bisect the arcs AC, CB and draw tangents at their 
middle points, then bisect the halves and draw tangents, and 
so on, we shall lastly arrive at a polygon such that the sum 
of the parts remaining between the sides of the polygon and 
the circumference of the segment is less than G. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 15 

Let the remainders be those between the segment and the 
polygon APQRSB, and let their sum be M. Join OP, OQ, 
etc. 

Then, as before, 



Also, as before, 

(surface of pyramid OAPQRSB excluding the face OA B) 

>the part OACB of the surface of the 

cone together with the segment ACB. 

Taking away the segment from each sum, 
A GAP + A OPQ + ... -f M> the part OACB of the 

surface of the cone. 
Hence, a fortiori, 

A OAE + A OEF+ A OFB + G, 
which is by hypothesis equal to 

&OAD + &ODB, 
is greater than the part OACB of the surface of the cone. 

Proposition 11. 

If a plane parallel to the axis of a right cylinder cut the 
cylinder, the part of the surface of the cylinder cut off by the 
plane is greater than the area of the parallelogram in which the 
plane cuts it. 

Proposition 12. 

If at the extremities of two generators of any right cylinder 
tangents be drown to the circular bases in the planes of those 
bases respectively, and if the pairs of tangents meet, the 
parallelograms formed by each generator and the two corre- 
sponding tangents respectively are together greater than the 
included portion of the surface of the cylinder between the two 
generators. 

[The proofs of these two propositions follow exactly the 
methods of Props. 9, 10 respectively, and it is therefore un- 
necessary to reproduce them.]

ARCHIMEDES 



" From the properties thus proved it is clear (1) that, if a 
pyramid be inscribed in an isosceles cone, the surface of the 
pyramid excluding the base is less than the surface of the cone 
[excluding the base], and (2) that, if a pyramid be circumscribed 
about an isosceles cone, the surface of the pyramid excluding the 
base is greater than the surface of the cone excluding the base. 

" It is also clear from what has been proved both (1) that, 
if a prism be inscribed in a right cylinder, the surface of the 
prism made up of its parallelograms [i.e. excluding its bases] is 
less than the surface of the cylinder excluding its bases, and 
(2) that, if a prism be circumscribed about a right cylinder, the 
surface of the prism made up of its parallelograms is greater 
than the surface of the cylinder excluding its bases.' 9 



Proposition 13. 

The surface of any right cylinder excluding the bases is equal 
to a circle whose radius is a mean proportional between the side 
[i.e. a generator] of the cylinder and the diameter of its base. 

Let the base of the cylinder be the circle A, and make CD 
equal to the diameter of this circle, and EF equal to the height 
of the cylinder. 






ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 17 

Let JET be a mean proportional between CD, EF, and B 
a circle with radius equal to H. 

Then the circle -B shall be equal to the surface of the 
cylinder (excluding the bases), which we will call 8. 

For, if not, B must be either greater or less than 8. 

I. Suppose B<8. 

Then it is possible to circumscribe a regular polygon about 
JB, and to inscribe another in it, such that the ratio of the 
former to the latter is less than the ratio S : B. 

Suppose this done, and circumscribe about A a polygon 
similar to that described about B\ then erect on the polygon 
about A a prism of the same height as the cylinder. The 
prism will therefore be circumscribed to the cylinder, 

Let KD, perpendicular to CD, and FL, perpendicular to

Bisect CD in Jf, and join MK. 

Then A KDM = the polygon about A. 

Also O EL = surface of prism (excluding bases). 

Produce FE to N so that FE = EN, and join NL. 

Now the polygons about A, B, being similar, are in the 
duplicate ratio of the radii of A, B. 

Thus 

A KDM : (polygon about B) = MD* : H* 



= MD:NF

Therefore 

(surface of prism about A) : (polygon in B) < S : B, 
and, alternately, 

(surface of prism about A) : 8 < (polygon in B) : S ; 

which is impossible, since the surface of the prism is greater 
than S, while the polygon inscribed in B is less than B. 

Therefore B^S. 

II. Suppose B>S. 

Let a regular polygon be circumscribed about B and another 
inscribed in it so that 

(polygon about jB) : (polygon in B) < B : 8. 

Inscribe in A a polygon similar to that inscribed in B, and 
erect a prism on the polygon inscribed in A of the same height 
as the cylinder. 

Again, let DK, FL, drawn as before, be each equal to the 
perimeter of the polygon inscribed in A. 

Then, in this case, 

A RDM > (polygon inscribed in A) 

(since the perpendicular from the centre on a side of the 
polygon is less than the radius of A). 

Also A LFN = O EL = surface of prism (excluding bases). 
Now 
(polygon in A) : (polygon in B) = MD* : H*, 

= &KDM : &LFN, as before. 
And A KDM > (polygon in A ). 

Therefore 

A LFN, or (surface of prism) > (polygon in B). 
But this is impossible, because 

(polygon about JB) : (polygon in B) < B : S, 

< (polygon about B) : 8, a fortiori, 
so that (polygon in B) > S,

Proposition 14. 

The surface of any isosceles cone excluding the base is equal 
to a circle whose radius is a mean proportional between the side 
of the cone [a generator] and the radius of the circle which is the 
base of the cone. 

Let the circle A be the base of the cone ; draw C equal to 
the radius of the circle, and D equal to the side of the cone, and 
let E be a mean proportional between C, D. 





Draw a circle B with radius equal to E. 

Then shall B be equal to the surface of the cone (excluding 
the base), which we will call 8. 

If not, B must be either greater or less than S. 

I. Suppose B < 8. 

Let a regular polygon be described about B and a similar 
one inscribed in it such that the former has to the latter a ratio 
less than the ratio 8 : B. 

Describe about A another similar polygon, and on it set up 
a pyramid with apex the same as that of the cone. 

Then (polygon about A) : (polygon about B) 



= (7:1) 

= (polygon about A) : (surface of pyramid excluding base). 

22 



20 ARCHIMEDES 

Therefore 

(surface of pyramid) = (polygon about B). 
Now (polygon about B) : (polygon in B) < 8 : B. 
Therefore 

(surface of pyramid) : (polygon in E) < 8 : B, 
which is impossible, (because the surface of the pyramid is 
greater than S, while the polygon in B is less than B). 
Hence B { S. 

II. Suppose B > S. 

Take regular polygons circumscribed and inscribed to B such 
that the ratio of the former to the latter is less than the ratio 
B:S. 

Inscribe in A a similar polygon to that inscribed in B, and 
erect a pyramid on the polygon inscribed in A with apex the 
same as that of the cone. 
In this case 

(polygon in A) : (polygon in B) = (7 s : E* 

= 0:J5 
> (polygon in A) : (surface of pyramid excluding base). 

This is clear because the ratio of G to D is greater than the 
ratio of the perpendicular from the centre of A on a side of the 
polygon to the perpendicular from the apex of the cone on the 
same side*. 

Therefore 

(surface of pyramid) > (polygon in B). 
But (polygon about B) : (polygon in B) < B : S. 
Therefore, a fortiori, 

(polygon about B) : (surface of pyramid) < B : 8 ; 
which is impossible. 

Since therefore B is neither greater nor less than 8, 



* This is of course the geometrical equivalent of saying that, if a, p be two 
angles each less than a right angle, and a>0, then sin a>sin /3.

Proposition 15. 

The surface of any isosceles cone has the same ratio to its 
base as the side of the cone has to the radium of the base. 

By Prop. 14, the surface of the cone is equal to a circle 
whose radius is a mean proportional between the side of the 
cone and the radius of the base. 

Hence, since circles are to one another as the squares of 
their radii, the proposition follows. 



Proposition 16. 

If an isosceles cone be cut by a plane parallel to the base, the 
portion of the surface of the cone between the parallel planes is 
equal to a circle whose radius is a mean proportional between (1) 
the portion of the side of the cone intercepted by the parallel 
planes and (2) the line which is equal to the sum of the radii oj 
the circles in the parallel planes. 

Let OA B be a triangle through the axis of a cone, DE its 
intersection with the plane cutting off the 
frustum, and OFC the axis of the cone. 

Then the surface of the cone OAB is 
equal to a circle whose radius is equal to 
V(M .AC. [Prop. 14.] 

Similarly the surface of the cone ODE 
is equal to a circle whose radius is equal 
to *JOlTDF. 

And the surface of the frustum is 
equal to the difference between the two circles. 

Now 

OA.AC-OD.DF = DA.AC+OD.AC-OD.DF. 
But OD.AC=OA.DF, 

since OA : AC = OD : DF. 




22 ARCHIMEDES 

Hence OA . AC - OD . DF = DA . AC + DA . DF 



And, since circles are to one another as the squares of their 
radii, it follows that the difference between the circles whose 
radii are \IOA.AC, ^OD.DF respectively is equal to a circle 
whose radius is ^DA.(AC + DF). 

Therefore the surface of the frustum is equal to this circle.

Proposition 17. 

If there be two isosceles cones, and the surface of one cone be

centre of the base [of the first cone] on the side of that cone is 
equal to the height [of the second}, the cones mil be equal

that OC = 



Then, since the base of OAB is equal to the surface of

(base of cone OAB) : (base of cone DEF) 

= (surface of DEF) : (base of DEF) 
= DF:FG [Prop. 15] 

= DG : GH t by similar triangles,

Therefore the bases of the cones are reciprocally propor- 
tional to their heights ; whence the cones are equal. [Lemma

Proposition 18. 

Any solid rhombus consisting of isosceles cones is equal to 
the cone which has its base equal to the surface of one of the 
cones composing the rhombus and its height equal to the perpen- 
dicular drawn from the apex of the second cone to one side of 
the first cone. 

Let the rhombus be OABD consisting of two cones with 
apices 0, D and with a common base (the circle about AB as 
diameter). 





Let FHK be another cone with base equal to the surface of 
the cone OAB and height FG equal to DE, the perpendicular 
from D on OB. 

Then shall the cone FHK be equal to the rhombus. 

Construct a third cone LMN with base (the circle about 
MN) equal to the base of OAB and height LP equal to OD. 

Then, since LP=OD, 

LP:CD=OD:CD. 

But [Lemma 1] OD:CD = (rhombus OADB) : (cone DAB\ 
and LP : CD - (cone LMN) : (cone DAB). 

It follows that 

(rhombus 04IXB) = (cone LMN) (1). 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 25 

Again, since AB*=MN t and 

(surface of OAB) = (base of FHK\ 
(base of FHK) : (base of LMN) 

= (surface of OAB) : (base of OAB) 
= OB:BC [Prop. 15] 

= OD : DE, by similar triangles, 
= LP : FG, by hypothesis. 

Thus, in the cones FHK, LMN, the bases are reciprocally 
proportional to the heights. 

Therefore the cones FHK, LMN are equal, 

and hence, by (1), the cone FHK is equal to the given 
solid rhombus. 

Proposition 19. 

If an isosceles cone be cut by a plane parallel to the base, 
and on the resulting circular section a cone be described having 
as its apex the centre of the base [of the first cone], and if the 
rhombus so formed be taken away from the whole cone t the part 
remaining will be equal to the cone with base equal to the mrface 
of the portion of the first cone between the parallel planes and 
with height equal to the perpendicular drawn from the centre of 
the base of the first cone on one side of that cone. 

Let the cone OAB be cut by a plane parallel to the base in 
the circle on DE as diameter. Let C be the centre of the base 
of the cone, and with C as apex and the circle about DE as base 
describe a cone, making with the cone ODE the rhombus 
ODCE. 

Take a cone FGH with base equal to the surface of the 
frustum DABE and height equal to the perpendicular (CK) 
from C on AO. 

Then shall the cone FGH be equal to the difference between 
the cone OAB and the rhombus ODCE. 

Take (1) a cone LMN with base equal to the surface of the 
cone OAB, and height equal to CK, 



26 



ARCHIMEDES 



(2) a cone PQR with base equal to the surface of the cone 
ODE and height equal to CK. 





M N Q R 

Now, since the surface of the cone OAB is equal to the 
surface of the cone ODE together with that of the frustum 
DABE, we have, by the construction, 

(base of LM N) = (base of FGH) + (base of PQR) 
and, since the heights of the three cones are equal, 
(cone LMN) = (cone FGH) + (cone PQR). 

But the cone LMN is equal to the cone OAB [Prop. 17], 
and the cone PQR is equal to the rhombus ODGE [Prop. 18]. 

Therefore (cone OA 5) = (cone FGH) + (rhombus ODCE), 
and the proposition is proved. 

Proposition 2O. 

If one of the two isosceles cones forming a rhombus be cut 
by a plane parallel to the base and on the resulting circular 
section a cone be described having the same apex as the second 
cone, and if the resulting rhombus be taken from the whole 
rhombus, the remainder will be equal to the cone with base equal 
to the surface of the portion of the cone between the parallel 
planes and with height equal to the perpendicular drawn from 
the apex of the second * cone to the Me of the first cone. 

* There is a slight error in Heiberg's translation "prioris ooni " and in the 
corresponding note, p. 93. The perpendicular is not drawn from the apex of 
the cone which is cut by the plane hut from the apex of the other.

Let the rhombus be OACB, and let the cone OAB be cut 
by a plane parallel to its base in the circle about DE as diameter. 
With this circle as base and C as apex describe a cone, which 
therefore with ODE forms the rhombus ODCE. 




Take a cone FGH with base equal to the surface of the 
frustum DABE and height equal to the perpendicular (CK) 
from C on OA. 

The cone FGH shall be equal to the difference between the 
rhombi OACB, ODCE. 

For take (1) a cone LMN with base equal to the surface of 
OAB and height equal to CK, 

(2) a cone PQR, with base equal to the surface of ODE, 
and height equal to CK. 

Then, since the surface of OAB is equal to the surface of 
ODE together with that of the frustum DABE, we have, by 
construction, 

(base of LMN) = (base of PQR) + (base of FGH), 
and the three cones are of equal height ; 
therefore (cone LMN) = (cone PQR) + (cone FGH). 

But the cone LMN is equal to the rhombus OACB, and the 
cone PQR is equal to the rhombus ODCE [Prop. 18]. 

Hence the cone FGH is equal to the difference between the 
two rhombi OACB f ODCE.

Proposition 23. 

Take a great circle ABC... of a sphere, and inscribe in it 
a regular polygon whose sides are a multiple of four in number. 
Let AA' t MM' be diameters at right angles and joining 
opposite angular points of the polygon. 







M' 



Then, if the polygon and great circle revolve together about 
the diameter AA' t the angular points of the polygon, except A, 
A', will describe circles on the surface of the sphere at right 
angles to the diameter A A'. Also the sides of the polygon 
will describe portions of conical surfaces, e.g. BC will describe 
a surface forming part of a cone whose base is a circle about 
CC' as diameter and whose apex is the point in which CB, 
G'B' produced meet each other and the diameter AA'. 

Comparing the hemisphere MAM' and that half of the 
figure described by the revolution of the polygon which is 
included in the hemisphere, we see that the surface of the 
hemisphere and the surface of the inscribed figure have the 
same boundaries in one plane (viz. the circle on MM' as

they are both concave in the same direction. 

Therefore [Assumptions, 4] the surface of the hemisphere 
is greater than that of the inscribed figure ; and the same is 
true of the other halves of the figures. 

Hence the surface of the sphere is greater than the surface 
described by the revolution of the polygon inscribed in the great 
circle about the diameter of the great circle.

be drawn, then the surface of the figure inscribed in the sphere 
by the revolution of the polygon about the diameter A A' is equal 
to a circle the square of whose radius is equal to the rectangle 
B A (BB' + CC' + ...). 

The surface of the figure is made up of the surfaces of parts

Then OBAB' is a solid rhombus, and its volume is equal to 
a cone whose base is equal to the surface of the cone ABB' and

Again, if CB, C'B' produced meet in T, the portion of the

BOG about AA' is equal to the difference between the rhombi 
OCTC' and OBTB' t i.e. to a cone whose base is equal to the 
surface of the frustum BB'G'C and whose height is p [Prop. 20]. 

Proceeding in this manner, and adding, we prove that, since 
cones of equal height are to one another as their bases, the 
volume of the solid of revolution is equal to a cone with height 
p and base equal to the sum of the surfaces of the cone BAB', 
the frustum BB'C'C, etc., i.e. a cone with height p and base 
equal to the surface of the solid. 



Proposition 27. 

The figure inscribed in the sphere as before is less than

By Prop. 26 the volume of the solid figure is equal to a cone 
whose base is equal to the surface of the solid and whose height 
isp, the perpendicular from on any side of the polygon. Let 
It be such a cone. 

Take also a cone S with base equal to the great circle, and 
height equal to the radius, of the sphere. 

Now, since the surface of the inscribed solid is less than four 
times the great circle [Prop. 25], the base of the cone R is less 
than four times the base of the cone S. 

Also the height (p) of R is less than the height of S. 
Therefore the volume of R is less than four times that of S', 
and the proposition is proved.

Proposition 28. 

Let a regular polygon, whose sides are a multiple of four in 
number, be circumscribed about a great circle of a given 
sphere, as AB...A'...B'A ; and about the polygon describe 
another circle, which will therefore have the same centre as the 
great circle of the sphere. Let AA' bisect the polygon and 

cut the sphere in a, of. 

M 




If the great circle and the circumscribed polygon revolve 
together about AA' y the great circle will describe the surface 
of a sphere, the angular points of the polygon except A, A will 
move round the surface of a larger sphere, the points of contact 
of the sides of the polygon with the great circle of the inner 
sphere will describe circles on that sphere in planes perpen- 
dicular to AA' y and the sides of the polygon themselves will 
describe portions of conical surfaces. The circumscribed figure 
will thus be greater than the sphere itself. 

Let any side, as BM, touch the inner circle in K, and let K' 
be the point of contact of the circle with B'M'. 

Then the circle described by the revolution of KK ' about 
A A' is the boundary in one plane of two surfaces

Now the second surface entirely includes the first, and they 
are both concave in the same direction ; 

therefore [Assumptions, 4] the second surface is greater 
than the first. 

The same is true of the portion of the surface on the opposite 
side of the circle on KK' as diameter. 

Hence, adding, we see that the surface of the figure 
circumscribed to the given sphere is greater than that of the 



Proposition 29. 

In a figure circumscribed to a sphere in the manner shown 
in the previous proposition the surface is equal to a circle the 
square on whose radius is equal to AB(BB' + CC' + ...). 

For the figure circumscribed to the sphere is inscribed in a 
larger sphere, and the proof of Prop. 24 applies. 

Proposition 3O. 

The surface of a figure circumscribed as before about a sphere 
is greater than four times the great circle of the sphere. 




ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 37 

Let AB...A'...B'A be the regular polygon of 4en sides 
which by its revolution about AA' describes the figure circum- 
scribing the sphere of which amam! is a great circle. Suppose 
aa', A A' to be in one straight line. 

Let R be a circle equal to the surface of the circumscribed 
solid. 

Now (BB' + CC' + ...):AA' = A'B:BA, [as in Prop. 21] 
so that AB(BB' + CC'+ ...) = AA'.A'B. 

Hence (radius of R) = */AA .A'B [Prop. 29] 

>A'B. 

But A 'E = 20P, where P is the point in which AB touches 
the circle ama'm'. 

Therefore (radius of R) > (diameter of circle amam') ; 
whence R> and therefore the surface of the circumscribed solid, 
is greater than four times the great circle of the given sphere. 

Proposition 31. 

The solid of revolution circumscribed as before about a sphere 
is equal to a cone whose base is equal to the surface of the solid 
and whose height is equal to the radius of the sphere. 

The solid is, as before, a solid inscribed in a larger sphere ; 
and, since the perpendicular on any side of the revolving polygon 
is equal to the radius of the inner sphere, the proposition is 
identical with Prop. 26. 

COR. The solid circumscribed about the smaller sphere is 
greater than four times the cone whose base is a great circle 
of the sphere and whose height is equal to the radius of the 
sphere. 

For, since the surface of the solid is greater than four times 
the great circle of the inner sphere [Prop. 30], the cone whose 
base is equal to the surface of the solid and whose height is the 
radius of the sphere is greater than four times the cone of 
the same height which has the great circle for base. [Lemma 1.] 

Hence, by the proposition, the volume of the solid is greater 
than four times the latter cone.

Then (radius of R)* = AB (BB f + CC' + . . .) [Prop. 29]

circumscribed and inscribed figures. [Props. 31, 26] 

Now, since the polygons are similar, 
AB : ab = 0a : p 

= (height of cone V) : (height of cone W) ; 

and, as shown above, the bases of the cones (the circles R t 8) 
are in the ratio of AB* to ab*. 

Therefore V : W = AB 9 : ab 3 . 

Proposition 33. 

The surface of any sphere is equal to four times the greatest 
circle in it. 

Let C be a circle equal to four times the great circle. 

Then, if C is not equal to the surface of the sphere, it must 
either be less or greater. 

I. Suppose C less than the surface of the sphere. 

It is then possible to find two lines , 7, of which $ is the 
greater, such that 

ft : 7 < (surface of sphere) : C. [Prop. 2] 

Take such lines, and let 8 be a mean proportional between 
them.

ARCHIMEDES 



Suppose similar regular polygons with 4sn sides circum- 
scribed about and inscribed in a great circle such that the ratio 
of their sides is less than the ratio ft : S. [Prop. 3] 




Let the polygons with the circle revolve together about 
a diameter common to all, describing solids of revolution as 
before. 

Then (surface of outer solid) : (surface of inner solid) 

= (side of outer) 8 : (side of inner) 8 [Prop. 32] 

<':$', or : 7 

< (surface of sphere) : (7, a fortiori. 

But this is impossible, since the surface of the circum- 
scribed solid is greater than that of the sphere [Prop. 28], while 
the surface of the inscribed solid is less than C [Prop. 25], 

Therefore C is not less than the surface of the sphere. 
II. Suppose C greater than the surface of the sphere. 
Take lines /3 9 7, of which ft is the greater, such that 
ft : y < G : (surface of sphere). 

Circumscribe and inscribe to the great circle similar regular 
polygons, as before, such that their sides are in a ratio less than 
that of ft to S, and suppose solids of revolution generated in the 
usual manner. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 41 

Then, in this case, 

(surface of circumscribed solid) : (surface of inscribed solid) 

< : (surface of sphere). 

But this is impossible, because the surface of the circum- 
scribed solid is greater than C [Prop. 30], while the surface of 
the inscribed solid is less than that of the sphere [Prop. 23]. 

Thus C is not greater than the surface of the sphere. 

Therefore, since it is neither greater nor less, C is equal to 
the surface of the sphere. 

Proposition 34. 

Any sphere is equal to four times the cone which has its base 
equal to the greatest circle in the sphere and its height equal 
to the radius of the sphere. 

Let the sphere be that of which ama'm' is a great circle. 

If now the sphere is not equal to four times the cone 
described, it is either greater or less. 

I. If possible, let the sphere be greater than four times the 
cone. 

Suppose V to be a cone whose base is equal to four times 
the great circle and whose height is equal to the radius of the 
sphere. 

Then, by hypothesis, the sphere is greater than F; and two 
lines ft, 7 can be found (of which fj is the greater) such that 

ft ' 7 < (volume of sphere) : F. 
Between and y place two arithmetic means 8, e. 

As before, let similar regular polygons with sides 4;i in 
number be circumscribed, about and inscribed in the great 
circle, such that their sides are in a ratio less than /8 : S. 

Imagine the diameter aa of the circle to be in the same 
straight line with a diameter of both polygons, and imagine 
the latter to revolve with the circle about aa', describing the 



42

surfaces of two solids of revolution. The volumes of these solids 
are therefore in the triplicate ratio of their sides. [Prop. 32] 
Thus (vol. of outer solid) : (vol. of inscribed solid) 

< /9 s : S s , by hypothesis, 

< 13 : 7, a fortiori (since : y > /3 s : 8 8 )*, 

< (volume of sphere) : V, a fortiori. 

But this is impossible, since the volume of the circumscribed 




* That ft : y>fP : 5 :j is assumed by Archimedes,

Take x such that /3 : 5 = 5 : .r. 

Thus 8 8 i 8=8 x '. d 

and, since /9>5, (3 8>8-x. 

But, by hypothesis, - 8 = 3 - e. 



Eutocius proves the 



Therefore 



8 - > 5 - x, 



Again, suppose d : x=x : y t 

and, as before, we have 8 - x > x - y, 

so that, a fortiori, i 

Therefore e

Now, by hypothesis, ft 5, or, y are in continued proportion ; 

therefore s : &=p : y 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 43 

jolid is greater than that of the sphere [Prop. 28], while the 
volume of the inscribed solid is less than V [Prop. 27]. 

Hence the sphere is not greater than F, or four times the 
sone described in the enunciation. 

II. If possible, let the sphere be less than V. 
In this case we take 0, y (@ being the greater) such that 
ft : 7 < F: (volume of sphere). 

The rest of the construction and proof proceeding as before, 
ve have finally 

(volume of outer solid) : (volume of inscribed solid) 
< F : (volume of sphere). 

But this is impossible, because the volume of the outer 
solid is greater than F [Prop. 31, Cor.], and the volume of the 
nscribed solid is less than the volume of the sphere. 

Hence the sphere is not less than F. 

Since then the sphere is neither less nor greater than F, it 
s equal to F, or to four times the cone described in the enun- 
ciation. 

COR. From what has been proved it follows that every 
cylinder whose base is the greatest circle in a sphere and whose 
height is equal to the diameter of the sphere is f of the sphere, 
ind its surface together with its bases is f of the surface of the 
sphere. 

For the cylinder is three times the cone with the same 
mse and height [Eucl. XII. 10], i.e. six times the cone with 
he same base and with height equal to the radius of the 
jphere. 

But the sphere is four times the latter cone [Prop. 34]. 
Therefore the cylinder is f of the sphere. 

Again, the surface of a cylinder (excluding the bases) is 
jqual to a circle whose radius is a mean proportional between 
;he height of the cylinder and the diameter of its base 
Prop. 13]. 



44 



ARCHIMEDES 



In this case the height is equal to the diameter of the base 
and therefore the circle is that whose radius is the diameter of 
the sphere, or a circle equal to four times the great circle of 
the sphere. 

Therefore the surface of the cylinder with the bases is equal 
to six times the great circle. 

And the surface of the sphere is four times the great circle 
[Prop. 33] ; whence 

(surface of cylinder with bases) = f . (surface of sphere). 



Proposition 35. 

If in a segment of a circle LAL' (where A is the middle 
point of the arc) a polygon LK...A...K'L' be inscribed of which 
LL f is one side, while the other sides are 2?i in number and all 
equal, and if the polygon revolve with the segment about the 
diameter AM, generating a solid figure inscribed in a segment of 
a sphere, then the surface of the inscribed solid is equal to a 
circle the square on whose radius is equal to the rectangle 

LL'\ 
h 2 






The surface of the inscribed figure is made up of portions of 
surfaces of cones. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 45 

If we take these successively, the surface of the cone BAB' 
is equal to a circle whose radius is 

[Prop. 14] 



The surface of the frustum of a cone BCC'B' is equal to 
a circle whose radius is 



A T* BB -\- CG rrfc -., 

AB. g- ; [Prop. 16] 

and so on. 

Proceeding in this way and adding, we find, since circles 
are to one another as the squares of their radii, that the 
surface of the inscribed figure is equal to a circle whose radius 

is 

'AB(BB' + CC'+... + KK' 



Proposition 36. 

The surface of the figure inscribed as before in the segment 
of a sphere is less than that of the segment of the sphere. 

This is clear, because the circular base of the segment is a 
common boundary of each of two surfaces, of which one, the 
segment, includes the other, the solid, while both are concave 
in the same direction [Assumptions, 4], 



Proposition 37. 

The surface of the solid figure inscribed in the segment of the 
sphere by the revolution of LK. ..A.. .K'L' about AM is less than 
a circle with radius equal to AL. 

Let the diameter AM meet the circle of which LAL' is a 
segment again in A'. Join A'B. 

As in Prop. 35, the surface of the inscribed solid is equal to 
a circle the square on whose radius is 

AB (BB' + CC' + . . . + KK' + LM). 



46 



ARCHIMEDES 



But this rectangle 




[Prop. 22] 



Hence the surface of the inscribed solid is less than the 
circle whose radius is AL. 



Proposition 38. 

The solid figure described as before in a segment of a sphere 
less than a hemisphere, together with the cone whose base is the 
base of the segment and whose apex is the centre of the sphere, 
is equal to a cone whose base is equal to the surface of the 
inscribed solid and whose height is equal to the perpendicular 
from the centre of the sphere on any side of the polygon. 

Let be the centre of the sphere, and p the length of the 
perpendicular from on AB. 

Suppose cones described with as apex, and with the 
circles on BB', CC',... as diameters as bases. 

Then the rhombus OBAB' is equal to a cone whose base is 
equal to the surface of the cone BAB', and whose height is p. 

[Prop. 18] 

Again, if CB, C'B' meet in T, the solid described by the 
triangle BOG as the polygon revolves about AO is the difference 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 



47 



between the rhombi OCTC' and OBTB', and is therefore equal 
to a cone whose base is equal to the surface of the frustum 
BCC'B' and whose height is p. [Prop. 20] 

Similarly for the part of the solid described by the triangle 
COD as the polygon revolves ; and so on. 




Hence, by addition, the solid figure inscribed in the segment 
together with the cone OLL' is equal to a cone whose base is 
the surface of the inscribed solid and whose height is p. 

COR. The cone whose base is a circle with radius equal to 
AL and whose height is equal to the radius of the sphere is 
greater than the sum of the inscribed solid and the cone OLL'. 

For, by the proposition, the inscribed solid together with 
the cone OLL' is equal to a cone with base equal to the surface 
of the solid and with height p. 

This latter cone is less than a cone with height equal to OA 
and with base equal to the circle whose radius is AL y because 
the height p is less than OA, while the surface of the solid is 
less than a circle with radius AL. [Prop. 37] 



Proposition 39. 

Let lal' be a segment of a great circle of a sphere, being less 
than a semicircle. Let be the centre of the sphere, and join 
Ol t 01'. Suppose a polygon circumscribed about the sector Olal' 
such that its sides, excluding the two radii, are 2/t in number 



48 



ARCHIMEDES 



and all equal, as LK, ... BA, AB' t ... K'L' ; and let OA be that 
radius of the great circle which bisects the segment lal'. 

The circle circumscribing the polygon will then have the 
same centre as the given great circle. 

Now suppose the polygon and the two circles to revolve 
together about OA. The two circles will describe spheres, the 




angular points except A will describe circles on the outer 
sphere, with diameters BB' etc., the points of contact of the 
sides with the inner segment will describe circles on the inner 
sphere, the sides themselves will describe the surfaces of cones 
or frusta of cones, and the whole figure circumscribed to the 
segment of the inner sphere by the revolution of the equal 
sides of the polygon will have for its base the circle on LL' 
as diameter. 

The surface of the solid figure so circumscribed about the 
sector of the sphere [excluding its base] will be greater than that 
of the segment of the sphere whose base is the circle on IV as 
diameter. 

For draw the tangents IT, I'T' to the inner segment at I, I'. 
These with the sides of the polygon will describe by their 
revolution a solid whose surface is greater than that of the 
segment [Assumptions, 4]. 

But the surface described by the revolution of IT is less 
than that described by the revolution of LT, since the angle TIL 
is a right angle, and therefore LT>IT. 

Hence, a fortiori, the surface described by LK...A...K'L' 
is greater than that of the segment. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 



49 



COR. The surface of the figure so described about the sector 
of the sphere is equal to a circle the square on whose radius 
is equal to the rectangle 



For the circumscribed figure is inscribed in the outer sphere, 
and the proof of Prop. 35 therefore applies. 



Proposition 4O. 

The surface of the figure circumscribed to the sector as before 
is greater than a circle whose radius is equal to al. 

Let the diameter AaO meet the great circle and the circle 
circumscribing the revolving polygon again in a', A'. Join 
A'B, arid let ON be drawn to N, the point of contact of AB 
with the inner circle. 




Now, by Prop. 39, Cor., the surface of the solid figure 
circumscribed to the sector 01 AV is equal to a circle the square 
on whose radius is equal to the rectangle 



But this rectangle is equal to A'B.AM [as in Prop. 22], 
H. A. 4 



50 ARCHIMEDES 

Next, since AL', al' are parallel, the triangles AML', ami' 
are similar. And AL' > al' ; therefore A M > am. 

Also A'B = 20N=aa'. 

Therefore A 'B . AM > am . ao! 

> al'\ 

Hence the surface of the solid figure circumscribed to the 
sector is greater than a circle whose radius is equal to al', or al. 

COR. 1. The volume of the figure circumscribed about the 
sector together with the cone whose apex is and base the circle 
on LL' as diameter, is equal to the volume of a cone whose base 
is equal to the surface of the circumscribed figure and whose 
height is ON. 

For the figure is inscribed in the outer sphere which has the 
same centre as the inner. Hence the proof of Prop. 38 applies. 

COR. 2. The volume of the circumscribed figure with the cone 
OLL' is greater than the cone whose base is a circle with radius 
equal to al and whose height is equal to the radius (Oa) of the 
inner sphere. 

For the volume of the figure with the cone OLL' is equal to 
a cone whose base is equal to the surface of the figure and 
whose height is equal to ON. 

And the surface of the figure is greater than a circle with 
radius equal to al [Prop. 40], while the heights Oa, ON are 
equal. 

Proposition 41. 

Let laV be a segment of a great circle of a sphere which is 
less than a semicircle. 

Suppose a polygon inscribed in the sector Olal' such that 
the sides Ik,... ba, ai', ...&T are 2n in number and all equal. 
Let a similar polygon be circumscribed about the sector so that 
its sides are parallel to those of the first polygon ; and draw 
the circle circumscribing the outer polygon. 

Now let the polygons and circles revolve together about 
OaA, the radius bisecting the segment lal*. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 



51 



Then (1) the surfaces of the outer and inner solids of revolution 
so described are in the ratio ofAB* to a& 8 , and (2) their volumes 
together with the corresponding cones with the same base and 
with apex in each case are as AB 3 to ab 9 . 




[Prop. 39, Cor.] 
ab (bV + cc' + . . . + kk' + -} . [Prop. 35] 



(1) For the surfaces are equal to circles the squares on 
whose radii are equal respectively to 



and 



But these rectangles are in the ratio of AB 9 to ab 9 . Therefore 
so are the surfaces. 

(2) Let OnNbe drawn perpendicular to ab and AB\ and 
suppose the circles which are equal to the surfaces of the outer 
and inner solids of revolution to be denoted by 8, s respectively. 

Now the volume of the circumscribed solid together with 
the cone OLL' is equal to a cone whose base is S and whose 
height is ON [Prop. 40, Cor. 1]. 

And the volume of the inscribed figure with the cone Oil' is 
equal to a cone with base s and height On [Prop. 38]. 

But S:s = AB*:ab*, 

and ON : On = AB:ab. 

Therefore the volume of the circumscribed solid together with 
the cone OLL' is to the volume of the inscribed solid together 
with the cone 01V as AB 9 is to 06* [Lemma 5],

Proposition 42. 

If lal' be a segment of a sphere less than a hemisphere and 
Oa the radium perpendicular to the base of the segment, the 
surface of the segment is equal to a circle whose radius is equal 
to al. 

Let R be a circle whose radius is equal to al. Then the 
surface of the segment, which we will call S, must, if it be not 
equal to R, be either greater or less than R. 




I. Suppose, if possible, S > R. 

Let lal' be a segment of a great circle which is less than a 
semicircle. Join 01, 01 ', and let similar polygons with 2n equal 
sides be circumscribed and inscribed to the sector, as in the 
previous propositions, but such that 

(circumscribed polygon) : (inscribed polygon) < S : R. 

[Prop. 6] 

Let the polygons now revolve with the segment about OaA, 
generating solids of revolution circumscribed and inscribed to 
the segment of the sphere. 

Then 

(surface of outer solid) : (surface of inner solid) 
= AB* : ab* [Prop. 41] 

= (circumscribed polygon) : (inscribed polygon) 
< S : R, by hypothesis. 
But the surface of the outer solid is greater than S [Prop. 39]. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 



53 



Therefore the surface of the inner solid is greater than R ; 
which is impossible, by Prop. 37. 

II. Suppose, if possible, 8 < R. 

In this case we circumscribe and inscribe polygons such that 
their ratio is less than R : S ; and we arrive at the result that 

(surface of outer solid) : (surface of inner solid) 
<R:S. 

But the surface of the outer solid is greater than R [Prop. 40]. 
Therefore the surface of the inner solid is greater than 8 : which 
is impossible [Prop. 36]. 

Hence, since S is neither greater nor less than jR, 



Proposition 43. 

Even if the segment of the sphere is greater than a hemisphere, 
its surface is still equal to a circle whose radium is equal to al. 

For let led' a' be a great circle of the sphere, aa being the 
diameter perpendicular to IV ; and let 
la'l' be a segment less than a semi- 
circle. 

Then, by Prop. 42, the surface of 
the segment la'l' of the sphere is 
equal to a circle with radius equal to 
al 

Also the surface of the whole 
sphere is equal to a circle with radius 
equal to aa' [Prop. 33]. 

But aa' 2 a7 2 = a*, and circles are to one another as the 
squares on their radii. 

Therefore the surface of the segment lal', being the difference 
between the surfaces of the sphere and of la'l', is equal to a 
circle with radius equal to al.

less. 

I. Suppose, if possible, that 8 > R. 

Find two straight lines ft, 7, of which ft is the greater, such 
that 

ft : 7 < S : R ;

Let lal' be a segment of a great circle of the sphere. 
Join 01, 01', and let similar polygons with Zn equal sides be 
circumscribed and inscribed to the sector of the circle as before, 
but such that their sides are in a ratio less than ft : S. 
[Prop. 4]. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER I. 55 

Then let the two polygons revolve with the segment about 
OaA, generating two solids of revolution. 

Denoting the volumes of these solids by F, v respectively, 
we have

</3 3 :5 8 

< $ : 7, a fortiori*, 

< S : R t by hypothesis. 
Now ( F 4- cone OLL') > S. 

Therefore also (v + cone Oil') > R. 

But this is impossible, by Prop. 38, Cor. combined with Props. 
42, 43. 

Hence 8 } R. 

II. Suppose, if possible, that S < R. 
In this case we take /8, 7 such that 
0:y<R:S t 

and the rest of the construction proceeds as before. 
We thus obtain the relation 

(F+ cone OLL) : (v + cone OH') < R : S. 
Now (v + cone Oil') < S. 

Therefore ( F 4- cone OLL) < R ; 

which is impossible, by Prop. 40, Cor. 2 combined with Props. 
42, 43. 

Since then S is neither greater nor less than -R, 

S = R.

" ARCHIMEDES to Dositheus greeting. 

On a former occasion you asked me to write out the proofs of 
the problems the enunciations of which I had myself sent to 
Conon. In point of fact they depend for the most part on the 
theorems of which I have already sent you the demonstrations, 
namely (1) that the surface of any sphere is four times the 
greatest circle in the sphere, (2) that the surface of any 
segment of a sphere is equal to a circle whose radius is equal 
to the straight line drawn from the vertex of the segment to 
the circumference of its base, (3) that the cylinder whose base 
is the greatest circle in any sphere and whose height is equal 
to the diameter of the sphere is itself in magnitude half as 
large again as the sphere, while its surface [including the two 
bases] is half as large again as the surface of the sphere, and 
(4) that any solid sector is equal to a cone whose base is the 
circle which is equal to the surface of the segment of the sphere 
included in the sector, and whose height is equal to the radius 
of the sphere. Such then of the theorems and problems as 
depend on these theorems I have written out in the book 
which I send herewith ; those which are discovered by means 
of a different sort of investigation, those namely which relate 
to spirals and the conoids, I will endeavour to send you soon. 



OX THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II. 



57 



The first of the problems was as follows : Given a sphere, to 
find a plane area equal to the surface of the sphere. 

The solution of this is obvious from the theorems aforesaid. 
For four times the greatest circle in the sphere is both a plane 
area and equal to the surface of the sphere. 

The second problem was the following." 

Proposition 1. (Problem.) 

Given a cone or a cylinder, to find a sphere equal to the cone 
or to the cylinder. 

If V be the given cone or cylinder, we can make a cylinder 
equal to f F. Let this cylinder be the cylinder whose base 
is the circle on AB as diameter and whose height is OD. 

Now, if we could make another cylinder, equal to the 
cylinder (OD) but such that its height is equal to the diameter 
of its base, the problem would be solved, because this latter 
cylinder would be equal to f F, and the sphere whose diameter 
is equal to the height (or to the diameter of the base) of the 
same cylinder would then be the sphere required [I. 34, Cor.]. 





Suppose the problem solved, and let the cylinder (CO) be 
equal to the cylinder (OD), while EF, the diameter of the base, 
is equal to the height CG. 



58 ARCHIMEDES 

Then, since in equal cylinders the heights and bases are 
reciprocally proportional, 



= EF: OD .................. (1). 

Suppose MN to be such a line that 

EF* = AB.MN ....................... (2). 

Hence AB : EF=EF:MN, 

and, combining (1) and (2), we have 

AB:MN=EF:OD, 

or AB:EF=MN:OD. 

Therefore AB:EF = EF : MN - MN : OD, 
and EF, MN are two mean proportionals between AB, OD. 

The synthesis of the problem is therefore as follows. Take 
two mean proportionals EF, MN between AB and OD> and 
describe a cylinder whose base is a circle on EF as diameter 
and whose height CG is equal to EF. 

Then, since 

AB : EF = EF: MN=MN : 



and therefore AB* : EF* = AB : MN 

= EF:OD 



whence the bases of the two cylinders (OJD), (CG) are recipro- 
cally proportional to their heights. 

Therefore the cylinders are equal, and it follows that 
cylinder (Cff) = f7. 

The sphere on EF as diameter is therefore the sphere 
required, being equal to V. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II. 



59 



Proposition 2. 

// BAB' be a segment of a sphere, BB' a diameter of the 
base of the segment, and the centre of the sphere, and if AA' 
be the diameter of the sphere bisecting BB 1 in M, then the volume 
of the segment is equal to that of a cone whose base is the same 
as that of the segment and whose height is h, where 

h:AM=OA' + A'M:A'M. 

Measure MH along MA equal to A, and MH' along MA 
equal to h', where 

h':A'M=OA+AM:AM. 

Suppose the three cones constructed which have 0, H 
H' for their apices and the base (BB') of the segment for their 
common base. Join AB, A'B. 




Let C be a cone whose base is equal to the surface of the 
segment BAB' of the sphere, i.e. to a circle with radius equal 
to AB [I. 42], and whose height is equal to OA. 

Then the cone Cis equal to the solid sector OBAR [I. 44]. 
Now, since HM : MA = OA 1 + AM : A'M, 
dividendo, HA:AM=OA: A'M, 

and, alternately, H A : AO = AM : MA\ 
so that 

HO : OA = A A' : A'M 
= AB* : BM* 
= (base of cone C) : (circle on BB' as diameter). 



60 ARCHIMEDES 

But OA is equal to the height of the cone C ; therefore, since 
cones are equal if their bases and heights are reciprocally 
proportional, it follows that the cone C (or the solid sector 
OBABf) is equal to a cone whose base is the circle on BR as 
diameter and whose height is equal to OH. 

And this latter cone is equal to the sum of two others 
having the same base and with heights OM, MH, i.e. to the 
solid rhombus OBHB'. 

Hence the sector OBAB' is equal to the rhombus OBHB'. 
Taking away the common part, the cone OB&, 

the segment BAB' = the cone HBB 1 . 
Similarly, by the same method, we can prove that 

the segment BA 'B' = the cone H 'BB'. 
Alternative proof of the latter property. 

Suppose D to be a cone whose base is equal to the surface 
of the whole sphere and whose height is equal to OA. 

Thus D is equal to the volume of the sphere. [I. 33, 34] 
Now, since OA' + A'M : A'M = EM : MA, 
dividendo and alternando, as before, 

OA : AH = A'M: MA. 

Again, since H'M : MA' = OA + A M : AM, 
H'A' : OA = A'M : MA 

= OA : AH, from above. 

Componendo, H'O : OA = OH : HA (1). 

Alternately, H'0:OH=OA : AH (2), 

and, componendo, EH' : HO = OH : HA, 

= H'0 : OA, from (1), 

whence HH ' . OA = H'O . OH (3). 

Next, since H'O : OH = OA: AH, by (2), 

-A'M :MA 9 
(H'O + OH? : H'O . OH = (A'M + MA? : A'M . MA, 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II. 



61 



whence, by means of (3), 

HH " : HE' . OA = AA'* : A'M. MA, 
or HH' : OA = A A 9 : BM\ 

Now the cone D, which is equal to the sphere, has for its base 
a circle whose radius is equal to A A', and for its height a line 
equal to OA. 

Hence this cone D is equal to a cone whose base is the circle 
on BB' as diameter and whose height is equal to HH' ; 

therefore the cone D = the rhombus HBH'B', 
or the rhombus HBH'B' = the sphere. 

But the segment BAB' = the cone EBB' ; 

therefore the remaining segment BA'B' the cone H'BB'. 

COR. The segment BAB' is to a cone with the same base and 
equal height in the ratio of OA' + A'M to A'M. 



Proposition 3. (Problem.) 

To cut a given sphere by a plane so that the surfaces of the 
segments may have to one another a given ratio. 

Suppose the problem solved. Let A A' be a diameter of a 
great circle of the sphere, and suppose that a plane perpendicular 
to A A' cuts the plane of the great circle in the straight 




line BB' t and AA' in M, and that it divides the sphere so that 
the surface of the segment BAB' has to the surface of the 
segment BA'B' the given ratio. 



62 



ARCHIMEDES 



Now these surfaces are respectively equal to circles with 
radii equal to AB, A'B [I. 42, 43]. 

Hence the ratio AB* : A'B 9 is equal to the given ratio, i.e. 
A M is to MA' in the given ratio. 

Accordingly the synthesis proceeds as follows. 

If H : K be the given ratio, divide A A' in M so that 



Then AM : MA' = AB* : A'B* 

= (circle with radius AB) : (circle with radius A'B) 

= (surface of segment BAB') : (surface of segment BA'B'). 

Thus the ratio of the surfaces of the segments is equal to 
the ratio H : K. 



Proposition 4. (Problem.) 

To cut a given sphere by a plane so that the volumes of the 
segments are to one another in a given ratio. 

Suppose the problem solved, and let the required plane cut 
the great circle ABA' at right angles in the line BE'. Let 
AA' be that diameter of the great circle which bisects BB' at 
right angles (in M ), and let be the centre of the sphere. 




that 
and 



Take H on OA produced, and H' on OA' produced, such 



OA' + A'M : A'M = HM : MA, (1), 

OA+AM:AM=H'M:MA' (2). 

Join BH, B'H, BH', B'H'. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II. 63 

Then the cones HBB', H'BB' are respectively equal to the 
segments BAB', BA'B' of the sphere [Prop. 2]. 

Hence the ratio of the cones, and therefore of their altitudes, 
is given, i.e. 

HM : H'M = the given ratio (3). 

We have now three equations (1), (2), (3), in which there 
appear three as yet undetermined points M, H, H' ; and it is 
first necessary to find, by means of them, another equation in 
which only one of these points (M ) appears, i.e. we have, so to 
speak, to eliminate H, H'. 

Now, from (3), it is clear that HH' : H'M is also a given 
ratio ; and Archimedes' method of elimination is, first, to find 
values for each of the ratios A'H' : H'M and HH' : H'A which 
are alike independent of H, H', and then, secondly, to equate 
the ratio compounded of these two ratios to the known value 
of the ratio HH 1 : H'M. 

(a) To find such a value for A'H' : H'M. 

It is at once clear from equation (2) above that 

A'H':H'M = OA : OA + AM (4). 

(b) To find such a value for HH' : A'H'. 
From (1) we derive 

AM : MA = OA + AM : HM 

= OA':AH (5); 

and, from (2), AM : MA = H'M : OA + AM 

= A'H': OA (6). 

Thus HA:AO = OA':A'H', 

whence OH : OA f = OH' : A'H', 

or OH:OH'=OA':A'H'. 

It follows that 

HH': OH'^OH' :A'H', 
or HH'.H'A'=OH". 

Therefore HH' : H'A' - OH" : H'A" 

= AA'* : A'M*, by means of (6) 



64 ARCHIMEDES 

(c) To express the ratios A'H' : H'M and HH' : H'M more 
simply we make the following construction. Produce OA to D 
so that OA = AD. (D will lie beyond H, for A'M> MA, and 
therefore, by (5), OA >AH.) 

Then A'H' : H'M = OA:OA+AM 

=AD:DM ..................... (7). 

Now divide AD at E so that 

HH':H'M = AD : DE .................. (8). 

Thus, using equations (8), (7) and the value of HH 1 : H'A' 
above found, we have 

AD:DE = HH':H'M 

- (HH' : H'A') . (A'H' : H'M) 
= (AA'*:A'M*).(AD:DM). 
But AD : DE = (DM : DE) . (AD : DM). 

Therefore MD : DE = AA* : A'M* ................. (9). 

And D is given, since -4J9 = OA. Also AD : DE (being equal 
to HH' : H'M) is a given ratio. Therefore DE is given. 

Hence the problem reduces itself to the problem of dividing 
A'D into two parts at M so that 

MD : (a given length) = (a given area) : A'M\ 
Archimedes adds : " If the problem is propounded in this 
general form, it requires a 40/3407409 [i.e. it is necessary to 
investigate the limits of possibility], but, if there be added the 
conditions subsisting in the present case, it does not require a 
810/0107105." 

In the present case the problem is : 

Given a straight line A' A produced to D so that A' A = 2AD, 
and given a point E on AD, to cut AA' in a point M so that 



" And the analysis and synthesis of both problems will be 
given at the end*." 

The synthesis of the main problem will be as follows. Let 
12 : 8 be the given ratio, R being less than 8. AA' being a

diameter of a great circle, and the centre, produce OA to D 
so that OA=AD, and divide AD in E so that 

AE : ED = R : 8. 
Then cut A A' in M so that 

MD : DE = AA" : A'M*. 

Through M erect a plane perpendicular to AA' ; this plane 
will then divide the sphere into segments which will be to one 
another as R to S. 

Take H on A' A produced, and H' on A A' produced, so that 
OA' + A'M :A'M = HM:MA, .............. (1), 

OA + AM : AM = H'M : MA' ............ (2). 

We have then to show that 

HM : MH' = R : S, or AE : ED. 
(a) We first find the value of HE' : H'A' as follows. 
As was shown in the analysis (6), 

HH'.H'A'=OH", 

or HE' : H'A' = OH'* : H'A'* 

= AA'*:A'M* 
= MD : DE y by construction. 
(/8) Next we have 

H'A' : H'M = OA : OA + AM 

= AD:DM. 

Therefore HH ' :H'M = (HH' : H'A') . (H'A : H'M) 

= (MD:DE).(AD:DM) 



whence HM : MH' = AE : ED

Note. The solution of the subsidiary problem to which the 
original problem of Prop. 4 is reduced, and of which Archimedes 
promises a discussion, is given in a highly interesting and 
important note by Eutocius, who introduces the subject with 
the following explanation. 

H. A. 5 



66 ARCHIMEDES 

"He [Archimedes] promised to give a solution of this 
problem at the end, but we do not find the promise kept in any 
of the copies. Hence we find that Dionysodorus too failed to 
light upon the promised discussion and, being unable to grapple 
with the omitted lemma, approached the original problem in a 
different way, which I shall describe later. Diocles also ex- 
pressed in his work irepl Trvpicov the opinion that Archimedes 
made the promise but did not perform it, and tried to supply 
the omission himself. His attempt I shall also give in its 
order. It will however be seen to have no relation to the 
omitted discussion but to give, like Dionysodorus, a construction 
arrived at by a different method of proof. On the other hand, 
as the result of unremitting and extensive research, I found in 
a certain old book some theorems discussed which, although the 
reverse of clear owing to errors and in many ways faulty as 
regards the figures, nevertheless gave the substance of what I 
sought, and moreover to some extent kept to the Doric dialect 
affected by Archimedes, while they retained the names familiar in 
old usage, the parabola being called a section of a right-angled 
cone, and the hyperbola a section of an obtuse-angled cone; 
whence I was led to consider whether these theorems might 
not in fact be what he promised he would give at the end. For 
this reason I paid them the closer attention, and, after finding 
great difficulty with the actual text owing to the multitude of 
the mistakes above referred to, I made out the sense gradually 
and now proceed to set it out, as well as I can, in more familiar 
and clearer language. And first the theorem will be treated 
generally, in order that what Archimedes says about the limits 
of possibility may be made clear ; after which there will follow 
the special application to the conditions stated in his analysis 
of the problem." 

The investigation which follows may be thus reproduced. 
The general problem is: 

Given two straight lines AB, AC and an area D, to divide 
ABatMsothat

Analysis. 

Suppose M found, and suppose AC placed at right angles to 
AB. Join CM and produce it. Draw EBN through B parallel 
to AC meeting CM in N, and through C draw CHE parallel to 
AB meeting EBN in E. Complete the parallelogram CENF, 
and through M draw PMH parallel to AC meeting FN in P. 

Measure EL along EN so that 

CE. EL (or A B . EL) = D. 
Then, by hypothesis, 
AM :AC=CE.EL: MB\ 
And 

AM: AC=CE :EN, 

by similar triangles, 

= CE.EL:EL.EN. c H 

It follows that PJV 2 = Jf J? 2 = EL . EN. 

Hence, if a parabola be described with vertex E t axis EN> and 
parameter equal to EL, it will pass through P ; and it will be 
given in position, since EL is given. 

Therefore P lies on a given parabola. 
Next, since the rectangles FH, AE are equal, 
FP.PH=AB.BE. 

Hence, if a rectangular hyperbola be described with CE, CF 
as asymptotes and passing through B, it will pass through P. 
And the hyperbola is given in position. 

Therefore P lies on a given hyperbola. 

Thus P is determined as the intersection of the parabola 
and hyperbola. And since P is thus given, M is also given. 



AM : AC = D : M B*, 



Now, since 



But AC. D is given, and it will be proved later that the mcmmum 
value of AM. MB* is that which it assumes when BM = 2AM.

Hence it is a necessary condition of the possibility of a 
solution that AG.D must not be greater than $AB.($AB)*> o?* 



Synthesis. 

If be such a point on AB that BO = 2AO, we have seen 
that, in order that the solution may be possible, 

AC.D^AO.OB*. 
Thus AC. D is either equal to, or less than, AO . OB*. 

(1 ) If A C . D = 4 . OB\ then the point itself solves the 
problem. 

(2) Let AC. D be less than AO. OB 9 . 

Place AC at right angles to AB. Join CO, and produce it 
to E. Draw EBR through B parallel to A G meeting CO in JR, 
and through C draw CE parallel 
to AB meeting EBR in E. Com- 
plete the parallelogram CERF, 
and through draw QOK parallel 
to AC meeting FR in Q and CE

Then, since 

AC.D<AO.OB\ 
measure RQ' along RQ so that 



Q Q' 





or AO:AC=D:Q'R\ 

Measure EL along ER so that 

D = CE.EL(orAB.EL). 
Now, since AO : AC = D : Q'R*, by hypothesis, 

= CE.EL:Q'R* t 
and AO:AC = CE: ER, by similar triangles, 

= CE . EL : EL . J?jf2, 
it follows that 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II. 69 

Describe a parabola with vertex E, axis ER, and parameter 
equal to EL. This parabola will then pass through Q'. 

Again, rect. FK = rect. A E, 

or FQ.QK = AB.BE; 

and, if we describe a rectangular hyperbola with asymptotes 
CE, OF and passing through B, it will also pass through Q. 

Let the parabola and hyperbola intersect at P, and through 
P draw PMH parallel to AC meeting AB in M and CE 
in H, and GPN parallel to AB meeting CF in G and ER 
inN. 

Then shall M be the required point of division. 
Since PG.PH=AB.BE, 

rect. GM=rect.ME, 
and therefore CMN is a straight line. 

Thus AB.BE = PO.PH = AM.EN (1). 

Again, by the property of the parabola, 
PN* = EL.EN, 
or MB* = EL. EN (2). 

From (1) and (2) 



or AM.AB:AB.EL = AB.AC:MB\ 

Alternately, 

AM.AB : AB.AC = AB.EL : MB\ 
or AM :AG = D:MB\ 



Proof of 8 1 o/j to-/* o 9. 

It remains to be proved that, t/ -45 be divided at so that

or AO.OB*>AM.MB\ 

where M is any point on AB other than 0.

ARCHIMEDES 



Suppose that AO : AC

Join CO, and produce it to N; 
draw EBN through B parallel w 
to AC, and complete the paral- 
lelogram CENF. 

Through draw POH 
parallel to AC meeting FN 
in P and CE in H. 

With vertex E, axis EN, 
and parameter EL', describe 
a parabola. This will pass 
through P, as shown in the 
analysis above, and beyond P 
will meet the diameter CF of 
the parabola in some point. 

Next draw a rectangular 
hyperbola with asymptotes CE, 
CF and passing through B. 
This hyperbola will also pass 
through P, as shown in the 
analysis. 

Produce NE to T so that 
TE = EN. Join TP meeting 
CE in F, and produce it to 
meet CF in W. Thus TP will 
touch the parabola at P. 

Then, since BO = 



CE. EL' : OB % , 
CE.EL'.AC. 




2AO, 



And TP = 2PY. 

Therefore PW=PY. 

Since, then, WY bet ween the asymptotes is bisected at P, the 
point where it meets the hyperbola, 

WY is a tangent to the hyperbola. 

Hence the hyperbola and parabola, having a common tangent 
at P, touch one another at P. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II, 71 

Now take any point M on AB, and through M draw QM K 
parallel to AC meeting the hyperbola in Q and CE in K. 
Lastly, draw GqQR through Q parallel to A B meeting OF in G, 
the parabola in q, and EN in R. 

Then, since, by the property of the hyperbola, the rectangles 
GK, AE are equal, CMR is a straight line. 

By the property of the parabola, 

qR* = EL'.ER, 

so that QR*<EL' .ER. 

Suppose QR* = EL . ER, 

and we have AM : AC = CE : ER 

= CE.EL:EL.ER 

= CE.EL:QR* 

= CE.EL:MB*, 

or AM.MB*=CE.EL.AC. 

Therefore AM. MB 9 < CE.EL' . AC 

<AO.OB\ 

If AC. D < AO . OB*, there are two solutions because there 
will be two points of intersection between the parabola and the 
hyperbola. 

For, if we draw with vertex E and axis EN a parabola 
whose parameter is equal to EL, the parabola will pass through 
the point Q (see the last figure) ; and, since the parabola meets 
the diameter CF beyond Q, it must meet the hyperbola again 
(which has CF for its asymptote). 

[If we put AB = a, BM = x, AC = c, and D = b\ the pro- 
portion 

AM: AC = D:Mff 

is seen to be equivalent to the equation 

a? 2 (a x) b*c, 
being a cubic equation with the term containing x omitted. 

Now suppose EN, EC to be axes of coordinates, EN being 
the axis of y*

Then the parabola used in the above solution is the

and the rectangular hyperbola is

Thus the solution of the cubic equation and the conditions 
under which there are no positive solutions, or one, or two 
positive solutions are obtained by the use of the two conies.]

the solutions of the original problem in Prop. 4 given by

Let AA! be a diameter of the given sphere. It is required 
to find a plane cutting A A' at right angles (in a point M, 
suppose) so that the segments into which the sphere is divided

Produce A 'A to F so that AF OA, where is the centre 
of the sphere. 




c ' E 

Draw AH perpendicular to AA' and of such length that 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II. 73 

and produce AH to K so that 

AK* = FA.AH ...................... (a). 

With vertex F, axis FA, and parameter equal to AH 
describe a parabola. This will pass through K, by the equa- 
tion (a). 

Draw A'K' parallel to AK and meeting the parabola in K' ; 
and with A'F, A'K' as asymptotes describe a rectangular 
hyperbola passing through H. This hyperbola will meet the 
parabola at some point, as P, between K and K'. 

Draw PM perpendicular to A A' meeting the great circle in 
B, B', and from H, P draw HL, PR both parallel to AA' and 
meeting A'K' in L, R respectively. 

Then, by the property of the hyperbola, 

PR.PM = AH.HL, 
i.e. PM.MA' = HA.AA' t 

or PM:AH = AA':A'M, 

and PM* : AH* = AA" : A'M\ 

Also, by the property of the parabola, 

FM.AH, 



or FM : AH = PM* : AH* 

= AA'* : A'M*, from above. 

Thus, since circles are to one another as the squares of their 
radii, the cone whose base is the circle with A'M as radius and 
whose height is equal to FM t and the cone whose base is the 
circle with AA' as radius and whose height is equal to AH, 
have their bases and heights reciprocally proportional. 

Hence the cones are equal ; i.e., if we denote the first cone 
by the symbol c (A'M), FM, and so on, 

c (A'M), FM = c (A A'), AH. 
Now c(AA'), FA : c(AA'), AH = FA : AH 

= CE : ED, by construction. 



74 ARCHIMEDES 

Therefore 

c (A A), FA : c (AM), FM = CE:ED (0). 

But (1) c (AA'\ FA = the sphere. [I. 34] 

(2) c (AM), FM can be proved equal to the segment of 
the sphere whose vertex is A' and height AM. 

For take 6 on A A' produced such that 
GM : MA = FM : MA 

= OA + AM : AM. 
Then the cone GEE' is equal to the segment A'EE' [Prop. 2]. 

And FM:MG = AM : MA, by hypothesis, 

= BM* : A'M\ 
Therefore 

(circle with rad. BM) : (circle with rad. AM) 

= FM : MG, 
so that c (AM), FM = c (BM ), M G 

= the segment ABE'. 

We have therefore, from the equation () above, 
(the sphere) : (segmt. A f BB') = GE : ED, 
whence (segmt. ABB') : (segmt. ABB') = CD : DE. 

Diodes' solution. 

Diocles starts, like Archimedes, from the property, proved in 
Prop. 2, that, if the plane of section cut a diameter AA of the 
sphere at right angles in M, and if H, H' be taken on OA, OA' 
produced respectively so that 

OA' + AM : AM = HM : MA, 
OA+ AM : AM=H'M : MA, 

then the cones HBB', H'EE' are respectively equal to the 
segments ABB', A'EE'.

Then, drawing the inference that 

HA :AM=OA':A'M, 
H'A' :A'M=OA : AM, 




he proceeds to stato the problem in the following form, slightly 
generalising it by the substitution of any given straight line for 
OA or OA': 

Given a straight line AA', its extremities A, A', a ratio C : D, 
and another straight line as AK, to divide AA' at M and to find 
two points H, H' on A' A and AA' produced respectively so that 
tJie following relations may hold simultaneously, 



HA :AM=AK:A'M 
H'A' : A'M = AK : AM 



(7). 



Analysis. 

Suppose the problem solved and the points M, H, H' all 
found. 

Place AK at right angles to AA', and draw A'K' parallel 
and equal to AK. Join KM, K'M, and produce them to meet 
K'A'> KA respectively in E, F. Join KK' y draw EG through 
E parallel to A' A meeting KF in G, and through M draw QMN 
parallel to AK meeting EG in Q and KK' in N. 

Now HA : A M = A'K 1 : A'M, by (), 

= FA : A M, by similar triangles, 
whence HA = FA. 

Similarly H'A' = A'E. 

Next, 

FA + AM : A'K' + A'M = AM : A'M 

= AK+ AM : EA' + A'M, by similar triangles. 



76 



ARCHIMEDES 



Therefore 

(FA + AM) . (EA f + A'M) = (KA + AM) . (K'A' + AM). 
Take AR along AH and A'R' along AH' such that 



Then, since FA + A M = HM, EA' + A'M = MH', we have 
HM.MH' = RM.MR' .................. (8). 

(Thus, if .R falls between A and IT, R f falls on the side of H' 
remote from A' y and vice versa.)

Now 



= RM. MR' : MH'\ by (8). 

Measure -ZlfF along MN so that MV=A'M. Join 4'F and 
produce it both ways. Draw RP, R'P' perpendicular to RR' 
meeting A'V produced in P, P' respectively. Then, the angle 
MA'V being half a right angle, PP' is given in position, and, 
since R, R' are given, so are P, P 7 . 

And, by parallels, 

P'V:PV=R'M :MR. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II. 77 

Therefore PV . P'F: PF a = RM . MR' : RM\ 

But PIT = 2RM*. 

Therefore PF. P'F = *RM . MR'. 

And it was shown that 

RM.MR' :MH'* = C:D. 

Hence PF. P'F : MH'* = 2C:D. 
But MH' = A'M + A'E = VM + MQ = QF 

Therefore QF 8 : PF. P'F = D : 2(7, a given ratio. 
Thus, if we take a line p such that 



and if we describe an ellipse with PP' as a diameter and p as 
the corresponding parameter [= DD'*/PP' in the ordinary 
notation of geometrical conies], and such that the ordinates to 
PP' are inclined to it at an angle equal to half a right angle, 
i.e. are parallel to QF or AK, then the ellipse will pass 
through Q. 

Hence Q lies on an ellipse given in position. 
Again, since EK is a diagonal of the parallelogram GK', 
GQ.QN=AA'.A'K'. 

If therefore a rectangular hyperbola be described with KG, 
KK' as asymptotes and passing through A', it will also pass 
through Q. 

Hence Q lies on a given rectangular hyperbola. 

Thus Q is determined as the intersection of a given ellipse

Let the hyperbola and ellipse meet in Q, and from Q draw 
QM VN perpendicular to AA' meeting AA' in M, PP' in V 
and KK' in N. Also draw GQE parallel to AA' meeting AK, 
A'K' respectively in G, E. 

Produce KA, K'M to meet in F. 
Then, from the property of the hyperbola, 
GQ.QN=AA'.A'K' 9 
and, since these rectangles are equal, KME is a straight line. 

Measure AH along AR equal to AF, and A'H' along A'R' 
equal to A'E. 

From the property of the ellipse, 

QV*:PV.P'V=p:PP' 
= D:2C. 

* Here too the Greek text repeats the same error as that noted on p. 77. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II. 79 

And, by parallels, 

PV:P'V=RM:R'M, 
or PV.P'V:P'V* = RM.MR':R'M*, 

while P'V* = 2R'M*, since the angle RA'P is half a right 
angle. 

Therefore PV.P'V=1RM. MR', 

whence QF" : 1RM. MR' = D:2C. 

But QV=EA' + A'M=MH'. 

Therefore RM.MR' : MH" = G:D. 
Again, by similar triangles, 

FA + A M : K'A' + A'M=AM: A'M 

= KA+AM:EA' + A'M. 
Therefore 

(FA + AM).(EA' + A'M) = (KA + AM). (K'A' + A'M) 
or HM.MH' = RM.MR'. 

It follows that 

HM.MH':MH'* = C:D, 

or HM : MH' = C: D (a). 

Also HA : AM = FA: AM, 

= A'K':A'M, by similar 

triangles... (/3), 
and H'A':A'M=EA':A'M 

= AK:AM ( 7 ). 

Hence the points M, H, H' satisfy the three given 
relations.] 

Proposition 5. (Problem.) 

To construct a segment of a sphere similar to one segment 
and equal in volume to another. 

Let ABB' be one segment whose vertex is A and whose 
base is the circle on BB' as diameter; and let DEF be another 
segment whose vertex is D and whose base is the circle on EF

as diameter. Let AA', DD' be diameters of the great circles 
passing through BB' y EF respectively, and let 0, C be the 
respective centres of the spheres. 

Suppose it required to draw a segment similar to DE F and 
equal in volume to ABB'. 

Analysis. Suppose the problem solved, and let def be the 
required segment, d being the .vertex and ef the diameter of 
the base. Let dd' be the diameter of the sphere which bisects 
e/at right angles, c the centre of the sphere. 




Let M, G, g be the points where BB', EF, ef are bisected 
at right angles by A A, DD' t dd' respectively, and produce 0-4, 
<7jD, cd respectively to H, K, k, so that 

OA' + A'M:A'M=HM:MA\ 



cd' + d'g:d'g = kg:gd 

and suppose cones formed with vertices H, K, k and with the 
same bases as the respective segments. The cones will then be 
equal to the segments respectively [Prop. 2], 

Therefore, by hypothesis, 

the cone HBB' = the cone kef. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II. 81 

Hence 

(circle on diameter BB') : (circle on diameter ef) = kg : HM, 
so that BB' s :ef* = kg:HM .................. (1). 

But, since the segments DBF, 'def are similar, so are the 
cones KEF, kef. 

Therefore KG : EF =* kg : ef. 

And the ratio KG : EF is given. Therefore the ratio kg : ef 
is given. 

Suppose a length R taken such that 

kg:ef=HM:R ..................... (2). 

Thus R is given. 

Again, since kg : HM= BB' 2 : ef 3 = ef:R 9 by (1) and (2), 
suppose a length 8 taken such that 



or B'*:ef* 

Thus BB' : ef=ef: 8 = 8 : R, 

and ef, 8 are two mean proportionals in continued proportion 
between BB', R. 

Synthesis. Let ABB', DEF be great circles, AA', DD' 
the diameters bisecting BB', EF at right angles in M, G 
respectively, and 0, C the centres. 

Take H, K in the same way as before, and construct the 
cones HBB', KEF, which are therefore equal to the respective 
segments ABB', DEF. 

Let R be a straight line such that 

KG:EF=HM: R, 
and between BB', R take two mean proportionals ef, 8. 

On ef as base describe a segment of a circle with vertex d 
and similar to the segment of a circle DEF. Complete the 
circle, and let dd' be the diameter through d, and c the centre. 
Conceive a sphere constructed of which def is a great circle, 
and through ef draw a plane at right angles to dd'. 
H. A. 6 



82 ARCHIMEDES 

Then shall def\>e the required segment of a sphere. 

For the segments DBF, def of the spheres are similar, like 
the circular segments DEF, def. 

Produce cd to k so that 

cd' + d'g : d'g = kg : gd. 
The cones KEF, kef&cQ then similar. 

Therefore kg : ef= KG : EF= HM : R, 
whence kg : HM = ef:R. 

But, since BB', ef, S, R are in continued proportion, 
BB": ef* = BB':S 

= ef:R 
= kg:HM. 

Thus the bases of the cones HBB', kef are reciprocally 
proportional to their heights. The cones are therefore equal, 
and def is the segment required, being equal in volume to the 
cone kef. [Prop. 2] 

Proposition 6. (Problem.) 

Given two segments of spheres, to find a third segment of a 
sphere similar to one of the given segments and having its 
surface equal to that of the other. 

Let ABB' be the segment to whose surface the surface of 
the required segment is to be equal, ABA'B' the great circle 
whose plane cuts the plane of the base of the segment A BB' at 
right angles in BB'. Let A A' be the diameter which bisects 
BB' at right angles. 

Let DEF be the segment to which the required segment 
is to be similar, DED'F the great circle cutting the base of the 
segment at right angles in EF. Let DD' be the diameter 
bisecting EF at right angles in 0. 

Suppose the problem solved, def being a segment similar 
to DEF and having its surface equal to that of ABB'\ and 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II. 



83 



complete the figure for def as for DEF, corresponding points 
being denoted by small and capital letters respectively. 




Join AB, DF, df. 

Now, since the surfaces of the segments def, ABB' are equal, 
so are the circles on df, AB as diameters ; [I. 42, 43] 

that is, df=AB. 

From the similarity of the segments DEF, def we obtain 

d'd : dg = D'D : DO, 

and dff:df=DG:DF; 

whence d'd : df= D'D : DF, 

or d'd:AB = D'D:DF. 

But AB, D'D, DF are all given ; 

therefore d'd is given. 
Accordingly the synthesis is as follows. 
Take d'd such that 

d'd:AB = D'D:DF. (1). 

Describe a circle on d'd as diameter, and conceive a sphere 
constructed of which this circle is a great circle. 

62 



84 ARCHIMEDES 

Divide d'd at g so that 



and draw through g a plane perpendicular to d'd cutting off 
the segment defof the sphere and intersecting the plane of the 
great circle in ef. The segments def, DEF are thus similar, 
and dg\df=DG:DF. 

But from above, componendo, 



Therefore, ex aequali, d'd : df= D'D : DF, 
whence, by (1), df= AB. 

Therefore the segment def has its surface equal to the 
surface of the segment ABB' [I. 42, 43], while it is also similar 
to the segment DEF. 

Proposition 7. (Problem.) 

From a given sphere to cut off a segment by a plane so that 
the segment may have a given ratio to the cone which has the same 
base as the segment and equal height 

Let AA' be the diameter of a great circle of the sphere. 
It is required to draw a plane at right angles to A A' cutting 
off a segment, as ABB', such that the segment ABB' has to 
the cone ABB' a given ratio. 

Analysis. 

Suppose the problem solved, and let the plane of section 
cut the plane of the great circle in BB', and the diameter 
AA' in M. Let be the centre of the sphere. 




Produce OA to H so that 

OA' + A'M : A'M = HM : MA. 



.(1). 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II. 85 

Thus the cone HBB' is equal to the segment ABB'. [Prop. 2] 

Therefore the given ratio must be equal to the ratio of the 
cone HBB' to the cone ABB', i.e. to the ratio HM : MA. 

Hence the ratio OA 1 -f A'M : A'M is given ; and therefore 
A'M is given. 



Now OA':A'M>OA' :A'A, 

so that OA' + A'M : A'M > OA' + A' A : A' A 

>3:2. 

Thus, in order that a solution may be possible, it is a 
necessary condition that the given ratio must be greater than 
3:2. 

The synthesis proceeds thus. 

Let A A' be a diameter of a great circle of the sphere, the 
centre. 

Take a line DE, and a point F on it, such that DE : EF is 
equal to the given ratio, being greater than 3 : 2. 

Now, since OA' + A' A : A' A = 3:2, 

DE : EF > OA' + A'A : A'A 9 
so that DF:FE> OA' : A'A. 

Hence a point M can be found on AA' such that 

DF : FE = OA' : A'M. ................... (2). 

Through M draw a plane at right angles to A A' intersecting 
the plane of the great circle in BB', and cutting off from the 
sphere the segment ABB'. 

As before, take H on OA produced such that 

OA' + A'M : A'M^HM : MA. 
Therefore HM :MA=DE : EF, by means of (2). 

It follows that the cone HBB', or the segment ABB', is to 
the cone ABB' in the given ratio DE : EF.

Proposition 8. 

If a sphere be cut by a plane not passing through the. centre 
into two segments ABB', ABB', of which ABB' is the greater, 
then the ratio 

(segmt. ABB') : (segmt. ABB') 

< (surface of ABB J : (surface of ABB J

Let the plane of section cut a great circle A BAB' at right 
angles in BE', and let AA be the diameter bisecting BB' at 
right angles in M. 

Let be the centre of the sphere. 
Join AB, AB. 




B' 



As usual, take H on OA produced, and H' on OA' produced, 
so that 

OA + AM:AM = HM:MA (1), 

OA+AM\AM=H'M:MA (2), 

and conceive cones drawn each with the same base as the two 
segments and with apices H, H' respectively. The cones are 
then respectively equal to the segments [Prop. 2], and they 
are in the ratio of their heights HM, H'M. 

Also 

(surface of ABB f ) : (surface of ABB') = Aff : AB* [I. 42, 43] 

= A'M:AM. 

* This is expressed in Archimedes 1 phrase by saying that the greater seg- 
ment has to the lesser a ratio "less than the duplicate (dur\d<rtoi>) of that which 
the surface of the greater segment has to the surface of the lesser, but greater 
than the sesquialterate (i)fu6\iov) [of that ratio]." 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II. 87 

We have therefore to prove 
(a) that H'M : MH < A'M* : MA*, 

(6) that H'M : MH > A'M* : MA*. 

(a) From (2) above, 

A'M : AM = H'M -.OA+AM 

= H'A' : OA', since OA = OA'. 

Since A'M > AM, H'A' > OA' ; therefore, if we take K on 
H'A' so that OA' = A'K, K will fall between H' and A'. 

And, by (1), A'M : AM = KM : MH. 

Thus KM : MH = H'A' : A'K, since A'K - OA, 

> H'M : MK. 

Therefore H'M . MH < KM*. 

It follows that 

H'M. MH : MH* < KM 1 : MH*, 
or H'M : MH < KM 1 : MH* 

< A'M* : AM 3 , by (1). 

(b) Since OA' = OA, 

A'M.MA<A'O.OA, 
or A'M : OA' < OA : AM 

< H'A' : A'M, by means of (2). 
Therefore A'M 1 < H'A' . OA' 

< H'A'. A'K. 
Take a point N on A' A such that 

A'N 1 = H'A'. A'K. 

Thus H' A' : A'K = A'N*: A'K* (3). 

Also H'A' : A'N = A'N : A'K, 

and, componendo, 

H'N : A'N= NK : A'K, 
whence A'N* : A'K 1 = H'lf* : NK*. 



88 ARCHIMEDES 

Therefore, by (3), 



Now H'M : MK>H'N: NK. 

Therefore H'M* : MK* > H'A' : A'K 

> H'A' : OA' 

> A'M: MA, by (2), as above, 
>OA' + A'M:MH,\>y(l), 
>KM:MH. 

Hence H'M* : MH* = (H'M * : MK*) . (KM 9 : MH*) 

>(KM:MH).(KM*-.MH*}. 
It follows that 



[The text of Archimedes adds an alternative proof of this 
proposition, which is here omitted because it is in fact neither 
clearer nor shorter than the above.] 



Proposition 9. 

Of all segments of spheres which have equal surfaces the 
hemisphere is the greatest in volume. 

Let ABA'B' be a great circle of a sphere, AA' being 
a diameter, and the centre. Let the sphere be cut by 
a plane, not passing through 0, perpendicular to AA' (at Jl/), 
and intersecting the plane of the great circle in BB'. The 
segment ABB 1 may then be either less than a hemisphere as 
in Fig. 1, or greater than a hemisphere as in Fig. 2. 

Let DED'E' be a great circle of another sphere, DD' 
being a diameter and C the centre. Let the sphere be cut by 
a plane through C perpendicular to DD' and intersecting the 
plane of the great circle in the diameter EE'. 



ON THE SPHERE AND CYLINDER II. 



89 



Suppose the surfaces of the segment ABB' and of the 
hemisphere DEE' to be equal. 




Since the surfaces are equal, AB = DE. 
Now, in Fig. 1, AB 2 > 2AM 2 and < 2AO\ 
and, in Fig. 2, AB 2 < 2AM 2 and > 2A 0\ 

Hence, if R be taken on AA' such that 



[I. 42, 43] 



R will fall between and M. 

Also, since AB 2 = DE 2 , AR = CD. 

Produce OA' to K so that OA' = 4' 
# so that 



, and produce A 9 A to 



or, componendo, A'K+A'M:A'M=HM:MA ............ (1). 

Thus the cone HBB' is equal to the segment ABB f . 

[Prop. 2] 

Again, produce CD to F so that CD = DJP, and the cone 
FEE 1 will be equal to the hemisphere DEE'. [Prop. 2] 

Now A R . RA' > AM. MA f t 

and 



90 ARCHIMEDES 

Hence 

AR . RA' + RA* > AM. MA + AM. A'K, 
or AA'.AR>AM.MK 

>HM.A'M, by (1). 
Therefore AA : AM > HM : AR, 
or AB* : BM 2 > HM : AR, 

i.e. AR 9 : BM* > HM : 2AR, since AB 2 

>HM:CF. 

Thus, since A R = CD, or CE, 

(circle on diam. EE') : (circle on diam. BB') > HM : CF. 
It follows that 

(the cone FEE') > (the cone HBB'), 

and therefore the hemisphere DEE' is greater in volume than 
the segment ABB'.
