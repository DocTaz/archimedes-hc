Postulate 1. 

" Let it be supposed that a fluid is of such a character that, 
its parts lying evenly and being continuous, that part which is 
thrust the less is driven along by that which is thrust the 
more ; and that each of its parts is thrust by the fluid which is 
above it in a perpendicular direction if the fluid be sunk in 
anything and compressed by anything else." 



Proposition 1. 

If a surface be cut by a plane always passing through a 
certain point, and if the section be always a circumference [of a 
circle] whose centre is the aforesaid point, the surface is that of 
a sphere. 

For, if not, there will be some two lines drawn from the 
point to the surface which are not equal. 

Suppose to be the fixed point, and A, B to be two points 
on the surface such that OA, OB are unequal. Let the surface 
be cut by a plane passing through OA, OB. Then the section 
is, by hypothesis, a circle whose centre is 0. 

Thus OA = OB ; which is contrary to the assumption. 
Therefore the surface cannot but be a sphere. 



254 ARCHIMEDES 

Proposition 2. 

The surface of any fluid at rest is the surface of a sphere 
whose centre is the same as that of the earth. 

Suppose the surface of the fluid cut by a plane through 0, 
the centre of the earth, in the curve A BCD. 

ABCD shall be the circumference of a circle. 

For, if not, some of the lines drawn from to the curve 
will be unequal. Take one of them, OB, such that OB is 
greater than some of the lines from to the curve and less 
than others. Draw a circle with OB as radius. Let it be EBF, 
which will therefore fall partly within and partly without the 
surface of the fluid. 




Draw OGH making with OB an angle equal to the angle 
EOB, and meeting the surface in H and the circle in 0. Draw 
also in the plane an arc of a circle PQR with centre and 
within the fluid. 

Then the parts of the fluid along PQR are uniform and 
continuous, and the part PQ is compressed by the part between 
it and AB 9 while the part QR is compressed by the part 
between QR and BH. Therefore the parts along PQ, QR will 
be unequally compressed, and the part which is compressed the 
less will be set in motion by that which is compressed the 
more. 

Therefore there will not be rest ; which is contrary to the 
hypothesis. 

Hence the section of the surface will be the circumference 
of a circle whose centre is ; and so will all other sections by 
planes through 0. 

Therefore the surface is that of a sphere with centre 0.

Proposition 3. 

Of solids those which, size for size, are of equal weight with 
a fluid mil, if let down into the fluid, be immersed so that they 
do not project above the surface but do not sink lower. 

If possible, let a certain solid EFHG of equal weight, 
volume for volume, with the fluid remain immersed in it so 
that part of it, EBCF, projects above the surface. 

Draw through 0, the centre of the earth, and through the 
solid a plane cutting the surface of the fluid in the circle 
ABCD. 

Conceive a pyramid with vertex and base a parallelogram 
at the surface of the fluid, such that it includes the immersed 
portion of the solid. Let this pyramid be cut by the plane of 
ABCD in OL, OM. Also let a sphere within the fluid and 
below GH be described with centre 0, and let the plane of 
ABCD cut this sphere in PQR. 




Conceive also another pyramid in the fluid with vertex 0, 
continuous with the former pyramid and equal and similar to 
it. Let the pyramid so described be cut in OM, ON by the 
plane of ABCD. 

Lastly, let STUV be a part of the fluid within the second 
pyramid equal and similar to the part BGHC of the solid, and 
let SFbe at the surface of the fluid. 

Then the pressures on PQ, QR are unequal, that on PQ 
being the greater. Hence the part at QR will be set in motion 



256 ARCHIMEDES 

by that at PQ, and the fluid will not be at rest; which is 
contrary to the hypothesis. 

Therefore the solid will not stand out above the surface. 
Nor will it sink further, because all the parts of the fluid 
will be under the same pressure. 

Proposition 4. 

A solid lighter than a fluid will, if immersed in it, not be 
completely submerged, but part of it will project above the 
surface. 

In this case, after the manner of the previous proposition, 
we assume the solid, if possible, to be completely submerged and 
the fluid to be at rest in that position, and we conceive (1) a 
pyramid with its vertex at 0, the centre of the earth, including 
the solid, (2) another pyramid continuous with the former and 
equal and similar to it, with the same vertex 0, (3) a portion of 
the fluid within this latter pyramid equal to the immersed solid 
in the other pyramid, (4) a sphere with centre whose surface 
is below the immersed solid and the part of the fluid in the 
second pyramid corresponding thereto. We suppose a plane to 
be drawn through the centre cutting the surface of the 
fluid in the circle ABC, the solid in 8, the first pyramid in OA, 
OB, the second pyramid in OB, OC, the portion of the fluid in 
the second pyramid in If, and the inner sphere in PQR. 

Then the pressures on the parts of the fluid at PQ, QR are 
unequal, since 8 is lighter than K. Hence there will not be 
rest ; which is contrary to the hypothesis. 




Therefore the solid 8 cannot, in a condition of rest, be 
completely submerged. 



ON FLOATING BODIES 1. 257 



Proposition 5. 

Any solid lighter than a fluid will, if placed in the fluid, 
be so far immersed that the weight of the solid will be equal to 
the weight of the fluid displaced. 

For let the solid be EGHF, and let BOHC be the portion 
of it immersed when the fluid is at rest. As in Prop. 3, 
conceive a pyramid with vertex including the solid, and 
another pyramid with the same vertex continuous with the 
former and equal and similar to it. Suppose a portion of the 
fluid STUV at the base of the second pyramid to be equal and 
similar to the immersed portion of the solid ; and let the con- 
struction be the same as in Prop. 3. 




Then, since the pressure on the parts of the fluid at PQ, QR 
must be equal in order that the fluid may be at rest, it follows 
that the weight of the portion STUV of the fluid must be 
equal to the weight of the solid EGHF. And the former is 
equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the immersed 
portion of the solid BOH C. 



Proposition 6. 

If a solid lighter than a -fluid be forcibly immersed in it, the 
solid will be driven upwards by a force equal to the difference 
between its weight and the weight of the fluid displaced. 

For let A be completely immersed in the fluid, and let G 
represent the weight of A, and (G + H) the weight of an equal 
volume of the fluid. Take a solid D, whose weight is H 

H. A. 17 



258 



ARCHIMEDES 



and add it to A. Then the weight of (A + D) is less than 
that of an equal volume of the fluid ; and, if (A + D) is 
immersed in the fluid, it will project so that its weight will 
be equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. But its weight 



s 



Therefore the weight of the fluid displaced is (G + H), and 
hence the volume of the fluid displaced is the volume of the 
solid A. There will accordingly be rest with A immersed 
and D projecting. 

Thus the weight of D balances the upward force exerted by 
the fluid on A, and therefore the latter force is equal to H, 
which is the difference between the weight of A and the weight 
of the fluid which A displaces. 



Proposition 7. 

A solid heavier than a fluid will, if placed in it, descend 
to the bottom of the fluid, and the solid will, when weighed 
in the fluid, be lighter than its true weight by the weight of the 
fluid displaced. 

(1) The first part of the proposition is obvious, since the 
part of the fluid under the solid will be under greater pressure, 
and therefore the other parts will give way until the solid 
reaches the bottom. 

(2) Let A be a solid heavier than the same volume of the 
fluid, and let (G + H) represent its weight, while G represents 
the weight of the same volume of the fluid. 



ON FLOATING BODIES I. 



259 



Take a solid B lighter than the same volume of the fluid, 
and such that the weight of B is G, while the weight of the 
same volume of the fluid is (G 4- H ). 



Let A and B be now combined into one solid and immersed. 
Then, since ( A + B) will be of the same weight as the same 
volume of fluid, both weights being equal to (G + H)+G, it 
follows that ( A + B) will remain stationary in the fluid. 

Therefore the force which causes A by itself to sink must 
be equal to the upward force exerted by the fluid on B by 
itself. This latter is equal to the difference between (G + H) 
and G [Prop. 6], Hence A is depressed by a force equal to 
H, i.e. its weight in the fluid is H, or the difference between 
G + H and G. 



[This proposition may, I think, safely be regarded as decisive 
of the question how Archimedes determined the proportions of 
gold and silver contained in the famous crown (cf. Introduction, 
Chapter I.). The proposition suggests in fact the following 
method. 

Let W represent the weight of the crown, w l and m, the 
weights of the gold and silver in it respectively, so that 



(1) Take a weight W of pure gold and weigh it in a fluid. 
The apparent loss of weight is then equal to the weight of 
the fluid displaced. If F^ denote this weight, F l is thus known 
as the result of the operation of weighing. 

It follows that the weight of fluid displaced by a weight w l 
of gold is .^i. 



172 



260 ARCHIMEDES 

(2) Take a weight W of pure silver and perform the same 
operation. If F* be the loss of weight when the silver is 
weighed in the fluid, we find in like manner that the weight 

of fluid displaced by w 2 is ~? . F* 

(3) Lastly, weigh the crown itself in the fluid, and let F be 
the loss of weight. Therefore the weight of fluid displaced by 
the crown is F. 

It follows that ^ . F l + ^ . Ft = F, 

or w 1 F l + w 2 F 2 (M! + w*) F } 

, w l F 2 - F 

whence iT* * 

This procedure corresponds pretty closely to that described 
in the poem de ponderibus et mensuris (written probably about 
500 A.D.)* purporting to explain Archimedes' method. Ac- 
cording to the author of this poem, we first take two equal 
weights of pure gold and pure silver respectively and weigh 
them against each other when both immersed in water; this 
gives the relation between their weights in water and therefore 
between their loss of weight in water. Next we take the 
mixture of gold and silver and an equal weight of pure silver 
and weigh them against each other in water in the same 
manner. 

The other version of the method used by Archimedes is 
that given by Vitruviusf, according to which he measured 
successively the volumes of fluid displaced by three equal 
weights, (1) the crown, (2) the same weight of gold, (3) the 
same weight of silver, respectively. Thus, if as before the 
weight of the crown is W, and it contains weights Wi and w z of 
gold and silver respectively, 

(1) the crown displaces a certain quantity of fluid, F say. 

(2) the weight W of gold displaces a certain volume of

fluid, V l say ; therefore a weight w l of gold displaces a volume 

^.^ of fluid. 
w 

(3) the weight W of silver displaces a certain volume of 
fluid, say F 2 ; therefore a weight w 2 of silver displaces a volume 

^.F 2 of fluid. 

It follows that F^.F, + ^.F 2 , 
whence, since W = w l + w 2 , 



and this ratio is obviously equal to that before obtained, viz. 



Postulate 2, 

" Let it be granted that bodies which are forced upwards in 
a fluid are forced upwards along the perpendicular [to the 
surface] which passes through their centre of gravity/' 

Proposition 8. 

If a solid in the form of a segment of a sphere, and of a 
substance lighter than a fluid, be immersed in it so that its base 
does not touch the surface, the solid will rest in such a position 
that its axis is perpendicular to the surface; and, if the solid be 
forced into such a position that its base touches the fluid on one 
side and be then set free, it will not remain in that position but 
will return to the symmetrical position. 

[The proof of this proposition is wanting in the Latin 
version of Tartaglia. Commandinus supplied a proof of his 
own in his edition.] 

Proposition 9. 

If a solid in the form of a segment of a sphere, and of a 
substance lighter than a fluid, be immersed in it so that its base 
is completely below the surface, the solid will rest in such a 
position that its aocis is perpendicular to the surface.

ARCHIMEDES 



[The proof of this proposition has only survived in a 
mutilated form. It deals moreover with only one case out of 
three which are distinguished at the beginning, viz. that in 
which the segment is greater than a hemisphere, while figures 
only are given for the cases where the segment is equal to, or 
less than, a hemisphere.] 

Suppose, first, that the segment is greater than a hemisphere. 
Let it be cut by a plane through its axis and the centre of the 
earth ; and, if possible, let it be at rest in the position shown 
in the figure, where AB is the intersection of the plane with 
the base of the segment, DE its axis, C the centre of the 
sphere of which the segment is a part, the centre of the 
earth. 




The centre of gravity of the portion of the segment outside 
the fluid, as F, lies on OC produced, its axis passing through C. 

Let G be the centre of gravity of the segment. Join FG, 
and produce it to H so that 

FG : GH = ( volume of immersed portion) : (rest of solid). 
Join OH. 

Then the weight of the portion of the solid outside the fluid 
acts along F0 t and the pressure of the fluid on the immersed 
portion along OH, while the weight of the immersed portion 
acts along HO and is by hypothesis less than the pressure of 
the fluid acting along OH. 

Hence there will not be equilibrium, but the part of the 
segment towards A will ascend and the part towards B descend, 
until DE assumes a position perpendicular to the surface of 
the fluid.

Proposition 1. 

If a solid lighter than a fluid be at rest in it, the weight of 
the solid will be to that of the same volume of the fluid as the 
immersed portion of the solid is to the whole. 

Let (A + B) be the solid, B the portion immersed in the 
fluid. 

Let (C + D) be an equal volume of the fluid, C being equal 
in volume to A and B to D. 

Further suppose the line E to represent the weight of the 
solid (A + B\ (F + G) to represent the weight of (<7+JD), and 
G that of D. 




Then 

weight of (A + B) : weight of (C+ D) - E : (F+ (?)... (1). 



264 ARCHIMEDES 

And the weight of (A -f B) is equal to the weight of a 
volume B of the fluid [I. 5], i.e. to the weight of D. 

That is to say, E=G. 
Hence, by (1), 

weight of (A + B) : weight of (G + D) = G : F+ G 



= B:A+B. 



Proposition 2. 

If a right segment of a paraboloid of revolution whose axis is 
not greater than %p (where p is the principal parameter of the 
generating parabola), and whose specific gravity is less than that 
of a fluid, be placed in the fluid with its cms inclined to the 
vertical at any angle, but so that the base of the segment does not 
touch the surface of the fluid, the segment of the paraboloid will 
not remain in that position but will return to the position in 
which its cuds is vertical. 

Let the axis of the segment of the paraboloid be AN, and 
through AN draw a plane perpendicular to the surface of the 
fluid. Let the plane intersect the paraboloid in the parabola 
BAB', the base of the segment of the paraboloid in BB', and 
the plane of the surface of the fluid in the chord QQ' of the 
parabola. 

Then, since the axis AN is placed in a position not perpen- 
dicular to QQ', BB' will not be parallel to QQ'. 

Draw the tangent PT to the parabola which is parallel to 
QQ', and let P be the point of contact*. 

[From P draw PV parallel to AN meeting QQ' in V. 
Then PV will be a diameter of the parabola, and also the 
axis of the portion of the paraboloid immersed in the fluid. 

* The rest of the proof is wanting in the version of Tartaglia, but is given 
in brackets as supplied by Gommandinus. 



ON FLOATING BODIES II. 265 

Let C be the centre of gravity of the paraboloid BAB', and 
F that of the portion immersed in the fluid. Join FC and 
produce it to H so that H is the centre of gravity of the 
remaining portion of the paraboloid above the surface.

it follows that 

Therefore, if CP be joined, the angle CPT is acutef. 
Hence, if CK be drawn perpendicular to PT, K will fall between 
P and T. And, if FL, HM be drawn parallel to CK to meet 
PT, they will each be perpendicular to the surface of the fluid. 

Now the force acting on the immersed portion of the 
segment of the paraboloid will act upwards along LF, while 
the weight of the portion outside the fluid will act downwards 
along HM. 

Therefore there will not be equilibrium, but the segment 

* As the determination of the centre of gravity of a segment of a paraboloid 
which is here assumed does not appear in any extant work of Archimedes, or 
in any known work by any other Greek mathematician, it appears probable that 
it was investigated by Archimedes himself in some treatise now lost. 

t The truth of this statement is easily proved from the property of the sub- 
normal. For, if the normal at P meet the axis in G, AG is greater than | 

except in the case where the normal is the normal at the vertex A itself. But 
the latter case is excluded here because, by hypothesis, AN is not placed vertically. 
Hence, P being a different point from A, AG is always greater than AC\ and, 
since the angle TPO is right, the angle TPC must be acute.

will turn so that B will rise and ff will fall, until AN takes 
the vertical position.] 

[For purposes of comparison the trigonometrical equivalent 
of this and other propositions will be appended. 

Suppose that the angle NTP, at which in the above figure 
the axis AN is inclined to the surface of the fluid, is denoted 
by 6. 

Then the coordinates of P referred to AN and the tangent 
at A as axes are 

j cot 2 0, - cot 0, 

where p is the principal parameter. 
Suppose that AN=h, PV=k. 

If now x 1 be the distance from T of the orthogonal projection 
of F on TP, and x the corresponding distance for the point (7,

In order that the segment of the paraboloid may turn in 
the direction of increasing the angle PTN, x must be greater 
than x, or the expression just found must be positive.

tion but mil return to the position in which the axis is vertical. 

Let the axis of the paraboloid be AN, and through AN

secting the paraboloid in the parabola BAB', the base of the 
segment in BNB', and the plane of the surface of the fluid in 
the chord QQ' of the parabola.

Then, since AN, as placed, is not perpendicular to the 
surface of the fluid, QQ' and BB' will not be parallel 

Draw PT parallel to QQ' and touching the parabola at P. 
Let PT meet NA produced in T. Draw the diameter PV 
bisecting QQ' in V. PV is then the axis of the portion of the 
paraboloid above the surface of the fluid. 

Let C be the centre of gravity of the whole segment of the 
paraboloid, F that of the portion above the surface. Join FC 
and produce it to H so that H is the centre of gravity of 
the immersed portion. 

Then, since AC ^ ^ , the angle CPT is an acute angle, as in

the last proposition. 

Hence, if CK be drawn perpendicular to PT, K will fall 
between P and T. Also, if H M, FL be drawn parallel to CK, 
they will be perpendicular to the surface of the fluid. 

And the force acting on the submerged portion will act 
upwards along HM, while the weight of the rest will act 
downwards along LF produced. 

Thus the paraboloid will turn until it takes the position 
in which AN is vertical.

Proposition 4. 

Given a right segment of a paraboloid of revolution whose 
axis AN is greater than $p (where p is the parameter), and 
whose specific gravity is less than that of a fluid but bears 
to it a ratio not less than (AN %p)* : AN* t if the segment 
of the paraboloid be placed in the fluid with its axis at any 
inclination to the vertical, but so that its base does not touch 
the surface of the fluid, it will not remain in that position but 
mil return to the position in which its axis is vertical. 

Let the axis of the segment of the paraboloid be AN, and 
let a plane be drawn through AN perpendicular to the surface 
of the fluid and intersecting the segment in the parabola BAB', 
the base of the segment in BB', and the surface of the fluid in 
the chord QQ' of the parabola. 




p T 



Then AN, as placed, will not be perpendicular to QQ 7 . 

Draw PT parallel to QQ' and touching the parabola at P. 
Draw the diameter PV bisecting QQ' in V. Thus PV will be 
the axis of the submerged portion of the solid. 

Let C be the centre of gravity of the whole solid, F that of 
the immersed portion. Join FC and produce it to H so that H 
is the centre of gravity of the remaining portion. 

Now, since A N = \ A C, 

and AN > f p, 



it follows that 



AG>\.

Measure CO along CA equal to ^ , and OR along OC equal to 



Then, since AN = \AC,

we have, by subtraction, 



That is,

or AR = (AN-$p). 

Thus (4^ - Jp) : 4-ZT 1 = 4E 2 : 4# 2 , 

and therefore the ratio of the specific gravity of the solid to 
that of the fluid is, by the enunciation, not less than the ratio 
AR* : AN*. 

But, by Prop. 1, the former ratio is equal to the ratio 
of the immersed portion to the whole solid, i.e. to the ratio 
PF 2 : AN* [On Conoids and Spheroids, Prop. 24]. 

Hence PV* : AN* { AR* : AN*, 

or PV< AR. 

It follows that 



If, therefore, OK be drawn from perpendicular to OA t it will 
meet PF between P and F. 

Also, if CK be joined, the triangle KCO is equal and similar 
to the triangle formed by the normal, the subnormal and the 
ordinate at P (since CO = $p or the subnormal, and KO is 
equal to the ordinate). 

Therefore CK is parallel to the normal at P, and therefore 
perpendicular to the tangent at P and to the surface of the 
fluid. 

Hence, if parallels to CK be drawn through F, H, they will 
be perpendicular to the surface of the fluid, and the force 
acting on the submerged portion of the solid will act upwards 
along the former, while the weight of the other portion will 
act downwards along the latter.

Therefore the solid will not remain in its position but will 
turn until AN assumes a vertical position.

Given a right segment of a paraboloid of revolution such that 
its aoris AN is greater than \p (where p is the parameter), and 
its specific gravity is less than that of a fluid but in a ratio to 
it not greater than the ratio [AN*- (AN-$p)*} : AN 1 , if the

to the vertical, but so that its base is completely submerged, it will 
not remain in that position but will return to the position in 
which AN is vertical. 

Let a plane be drawn through AN, as placed, perpendicular 
to the surface of the fluid and cutting the segment of the 
paraboloid in the parabola BAB', the base of the segment in 
BB' 9 and the plane of the surface of the fluid in the chord 
QQ' of the parabola. 

Draw the tangent PT parallel to QQ', and the diameter

Therefore, if a perpendicular to AC be drawn from 0, it will 
meet PF in some point K between P and F. 

And, since CO = \p> CK will be perpendicular to PT, as in 
the last proposition. 

Now the force acting on the submerged portion of the solid 
will act upwards through H, and the weight of the other 
portion downwards through F, in directions parallel in both 
cases to CK\ whence the proposition follows. 

Proposition 6. 

If a right segment of a paraboloid lighter than a fluid be 
such that its a&is AM is greater than fjp, but AM : %p < 15 : 4, 
and if the segment be placed in the fluid with its axis so inclined 
to the vertical that its base touclies the fluid, it will never remain 
in such a position that the base touches the surface in one point 
only. 

Suppose the segment of the paraboloid to be placed in the 
position described, and let the plane through the axis AM 
perpendicular to the surface of the fluid intersect the segment 
of the paraboloid in the parabolic segment BAB' and the plane 
of the surface of the fluid in BQ. 

Take C on AM such that AC=2CM (or so that C is the 
centre of gravity of the segment of the paraboloid), and measure 
CK along CA such that 

AM:CK=lo :4.

contained. The following proof is shorter than Robertson's (in the Appendix

Let BQ meet AM in U t and let PN be the ordinate from P to AM. 

We have to prove that PV . AK o r> PI . KM, or in other words that

Then, since CO = %p, CL must be perpendicular to PT and 
therefore to the surface of the fluid. 

And the forces acting on the immersed portion of the 
paraboloid and the portion above the surface act respectively 
upwards and downwards along lines through F and H parallel 
to CL. 

Hence the paraboloid cannot remain in the position in which 
B just touches the surface, but must turn in the direction of 
increasing the angle PTM. 

The proof is the same in the case where the point / is not 
on VP but on VP produced, as in the second figure*.

Now, since CO = Jp, CL is perpendicular to the surface of 
the fluid ; therefore so are the parallels to CL through F and 
H. But the force on the immersed portion acts upwards 
through F and that on the rest of the solid downwards 
through H. 

Therefore the solid will not rest but turn in the direction of 
diminishing the angle MTP. 

II. Suppose the angle OTP less than the angle dab. In 
this case, we shall have, instead of the above results, the 
following,

NO<X. 

Also PF>fPZ,

Make PF equal to 2F] r , so that F is the centre of gravity 
of the immersed portion. 

And, proceeding as before, we prove in this case that the 
solid will turn in the direction of increasing the angle MTP. 

III. When the angle MTP is equal to the angle daft, 
equalities replace inequalities in the results obtained, and L is 
itself the centre of gravity of the immersed portion. Thus all 
the forces act in one straight line, the perpendicular CL\

Again, since the specific gravity of the solid is to that of 
the fluid as the immersed portion of the solid to the whole, 

AM * - (X + F) 2 : A M * = AM* - PV* : AM*,

That is, X+Y=PV. 

And PL (or NO) >X 



so that PL>2LV. 

Take F on PV so that PF = 2FV. Then F is the centre 
of gravity of the portion of the solid above the surface. 

Also C is the centre of gravity of the whole solid. Join PC 
and produce it to IT, the centre of gravity of the immersed 
portion. 

Then, since CO = \p> CL is perpendicular to PT and to the 
surface of the fluid ; and the force acting on the immersed 
portion of the solid acts upwards along the parallel to CL 
through H, while the weight of the rest of the solid acts down- 
wards along the parallel to CL through F. 

Hence the solid will not rest but turn in the direction of 
diminishing the angle MTP. 

II. Exactly as in the last proposition, we prove that, if the 
angle MTP be less than the angle dab, the solid will not remain

angle M TP. 




III. If the angle MTP is equal to the angle dab, the solid

Then, since the three parabolic segments are similar and

First, since AA^A B B is a straight line, and AN=AT with the ordinary

Now, since CO = %p, GL is perpendicular to the tangent at 
P and to the surface of the fluid. Thus, as before, we prove 
that the solid will not rest with -B touching the surface, but will 
turn in the direction of increasing the angle PTN.

axis is inclined at an angle to the vertical.

Let the plane through AM perpendicular to the surface of 
the fluid cut the paraboloid in the parabola BAB' and the 




plane of the surface of the fluid in QQ'. Let PT be the tangent 
parallel to QQ', PV the diameter bisecting QQ', PN the ordinate 
at P. 



Divide AM as before at C, 0.

In the other figure let Q^' be the ordinate at Q lt Join 
BQ 9 and produce it to meet the outer parabola in q. Then 
and the tangent &U is parallel to Bq. Now 

: A M * = (spec. gr. of solid) : (spec. gr. of fluid) 
= (portion immersed) : (whole solid) 



Therefore Q& = PF; and the segments QPQ', BQ,q of the 
paraboloid are equal in volume. And the base of one passes 
through B, while the base of the other passes through Q, a point 
nearer to A than B is. 

It follows that the angle between QQ' and BE' is less than 
the angle B^q. 

Therefore ^U<^ PTN, 

whence AN' > AN, 

and therefore N'O (or Q&) < PL, 

where OL is perpendicular to PF. 

It follows, since Q& = 2Q 2 Q 8 , that 
PL>2LV. 

Therefore F y the centre of gravity of the immersed portion 
of the solid, is between P and Z, while, as before, OL is perpen- 
dicular to the surface of the fluid. 

Producing FC to H, the centre of gravity of the portion of 
the solid above the surface, we see that the solid must turn in 
the direction of diminishing the angle PTN until one point B 
of the base just touches the surface of the fluid. 

When this is the case, we shall have a segment BPQ equal 
and similar to the segment J3Qij, the angle PTN will be equal 
to the angle U> and AN will be equal to AN'. 

Hence in this case PL = 2LV t and F t L coincide, so that F y 
C y H are all in one vertical straight line. 

Thus the paraboloid will remain in the position in which 
one point B of the base touches the surface of the fluid, and the 
axis makes with the surface an angle equal to U.

(III. 6) In the case where 
(spec. gr. of solid) : (spec. gr. of fluid) 



? : A M* 9 



we can prove in the same way that, if the solid be placed in the 
fluid so that its axis is inclined to the vertical and its base does 
not anywhere touch the surface of the fluid, the solid will take 
up and rest in the position in which one point only of the base 
touches the surface, and the axis is inclined to it at an angle 
equal to T! (in the figure on p. 284). 

(IV.) In this case 

(spec. gr. of solid) : (spec. gr. of fluid) > PiP* : AM* 

but < Q,Q 3 * : AM*. 

Suppose the ratio to be equal to P : AM*, so that I is greater 
than PxPs but less than 



Place P'V between the parabolas BP&, jBP 3 Q 3 so that 
P'V is equal to I and parallel to AM, and let P'V meet the 
intermediate parabola in F' and OQJP^ i n ! 




Join BV and produce it to meet the outer parabola in q. 

Then, as before, BV = Vq, and accordingly the tangent 
P'T at P' is parallel to Bq. Let P'N' be the ordinate of P'.

1. Now let the segment be placed in the fluid, first, with 
its axis so inclined to the vertical that its base does not 
anywhere touch the surface of the fluid. 




Let the plane through AM perpendicular to the surface of 
the fluid cut the paraboloid in the parabola BAB' and the 
plane of the surface of the fluid in QQ'. Let PT be the 
tangent parallel to QQ', PV the diameter bisecting QQ'. 
Divide AM at (7, as before, and draw OL perpendicular to PV. 

Then, as before, we have PF= I = P'V. 

Thus the segments BP'q> QPQ' of the paraboloid are equal 
in volume ; and it follows that the angle between QQ' and BB' 
is less than the angle BJiq. 

Therefore Z P'T'N' < ^ PTN, 

and hence AN' > AN, 

so that NO > N'O, 

i.e. PL>P'I 

>P'F' t a fortiori. 

Thus PL >2LV, so that F, the centre of gravity of the 
immersed portion of the solid, is between L and P, while CL 
is perpendicular to the surface of the fluid.

295 



If then we produce FC to H, the centre of gravity of the 
portion of the solid above the surface, we prove that the solid 
will not rest but turn in the direction of diminishing the 
angle PTN. 

2, Next let the paraboloid be so placed in the fluid that 
its base touches the surface of the fluid at one point B only, 
and let the construction proceed as before. 

Then P7 = P'F', and the segments BPQ, BP'q are equal 
and similar, so that 



It follows that 
and therefore 
whence 



AN = AN', NO = N'O, 
P'l = PL, 
PL>2LV. 




Thus F again lies between P and L, and, as before, the 
paraboloid will turn in the direction of diminishing the angle 
PTN> i.e. so that the base will be more submerged. 

(V.) In this case 
(spec. gr. of solid) : (spec. gr. of fluid) < P^P,* : AM*. 

If then the ratio is equal to J f : AM*, I < P,P 3 . Place P'V 
between the parabolas BPiQi and P S Q* equal in length to I

and parallel to AM. Let P'V meet the intermediate parabola 
in F' and OP a in /. 

Join BV and produce it to meet the outer parabola in q. 
Then, as before, BV = F'g, and the tangent PT' is parallel 
to Bq. 




1. Let the paraboloid be so placed in the fluid that its 
base touches the surface at one point only. 




ON FLOATING BODIES II. 



297 



Let the plane through AM perpendicular to the surface 
of the fluid cut the paraboloid in the parabolic section BAB' 
and the plane of the surface of the fluid in BQ. 

Making the usual construction, we find 



and the segments BPQ, BP^q are equal and similar. 

Therefore t PTN = P'T'N', 

and AN = AN',N'0 = NO. 

Therefore PL = P7, 

whence it follows that PL < ZLV. 

Thus jP, the centre of gravity of the immersed portion of the 
solid, lies between L and V, while CL is perpendicular to the 
surface of the fluid. 

Producing FC to H, the centre of gravity of the portion 
above the surface, we prove, as usual, that there will not be 
rest, but the solid will turn in the direction of increasing the 
angle PTN, so that the base will not anywhere touch the 
surface. 

2. The solid will however rest in a position where its axis 
makes with the surface of the fluid an angle less than T,. 




298 ARCHIMEDES 

For let it be placed so that the angle PTN is not less 
than 7\. 

Then, with the same construction as before, PF = I = P'V. 
And, since 



and therefore NO <(: Nfi, where P^ is the ordinate of Pj. 
Hence PL { P^. 

But PiP*>P'F'. 

Therefore PZ>gPF, 

so that F, the centre of gravity of the immersed portion of 
the solid, lies between P and L. 

Thus the solid will turn in the direction of diminishing 
the angle PTN until that angle becomes less than 2\. 



[As before, if x, x' be the distances from T of the orthogonal 
projections of (7, F respectively on TP, we have 

x' - x = cos J (cot 8 6 + 2) - | (h - k)l ....... (1), 



Also, if the base BB' touch the surface of the fluid at one 
point B, we have further, as in the note following Prop. 6, 

(2), 



and A-& = V^cot0-cot*0 ............ (3). 

Therefore, to find the relation between h and the angle 6 at 
which the axis of the paraboloid is inclined to the surface of the 
fluid in a position of equilibrium with B just touching the 
surface, we eliminate k and equate the expression in (1) to 
zero; thus 



| (cot* 6 + 2) - 1 (\/ph cot -| cot* Bj = 0, 
or 5pcot f 0-8\/;>cot0 + 6/> = ............ (4). 



ON FLOATING BODIES II. 299 

The two values of are given by the equations 

5 Vp cot = W/i V16A - 30p ............ (5). 

The lower sign corresponds to the angle U, and the upper 
sign to the angle T 19 in the proposition of Archimedes, as can 
be verified thus. 

In the first figure of Archimedes (p. 284 above) we have 



If PJ\Ps meet EM in D', it follows that

Now, from the property of the parabola,

which agrees with the result (5) above. 

To find the corresponding ratio of the specific gravities, or 
Iffl?, we have to use equations (2) and (5) and to express k in 
terms of h and p.

Equation (2) gives, on the substitution in it of the value of 
cot 6 contained in (5), 



whence we obtain, by squaring, 

(6). 



The lower sign corresponds to the angle U and the upper to 
the angle 2\, and, in order to verify the results of Archimedes, 
we have simply to show that the two values of k are equal to 
QiQz,P*P* respectively. 

Now it is easily seen that 

<2.i = A/2 - MD'fp + 2M a D'/ P> 



Therefore, using the values of MD, ML', M 3 D, M 3 D' above 
found, we have
