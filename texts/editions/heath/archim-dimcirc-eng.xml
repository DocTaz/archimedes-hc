MEASUBEMENT OF A CIRCLE. 



Proposition 1. 

The area of any circle is equal to a right-angled triangle in 
which one of the sides about the right angle is equal to the radius, 
and the other to the circumference, of the circle. 

Let ABCD be the given circle, K the triangle described. 




Then, if the circle is not equal to K, it must be either 
greater or less. 

I. If possible, let the circle be greater than K. 

Inscribe a square ABCD, bisect the arcs AB, BC, CD, DA, 
then bisect (if necessary) the halves, and so on, until the sides 
of the inscribed polygon whose angular points are the points of 
division subtend segments whose sum is less than the excess of 
the area of the circle over K. 



92 ARCHIMEDES 

Thus the area of the polygon is greater than K. 

Let AE be any side of it, and ON the perpendicular on A E 
from the centre 0. 

Then ON is less than the radius of the circle and therefore 
less than one of the sides about the right angle in K. Also the 
perimeter of the polygon is less than the circumference of the 
circle, i.e. less than the other side about the right angle in K. 

Therefore the area of the polygon is less than K ; which is 
inconsistent with the hypothesis. 

Thus the area of the circle is not greater than K. 

II. If possible, let the circle be less than K. 

Circumscribe a square, and let two adjacent sides, touching 
the circle in E, H, meet in T. Bisect the arcs between adjacent 
points of contact and draw the tangents at the points of 
bisection. Let A be the middle point of the arc EH, and FAG 
the tangent at A. 

Then the angle TAG is a right angle. 
Therefore TG > GA 

>GH. 

It follows that the triangle FTG is greater than half the area 
TEAH. 

Similarly, if the arc AH be bisected and the tangent at the 
point of bisection be drawn, it will cut off from the area GAH 
more than one-half. 

Thus, by continuing the process, we shall ultimately arrive 
at a circumscribed polygon such that the spaces intercepted 
between it and the circle are together less than the excess of 
K over the area of the circle. 

Thus the area of the polygon will be less than K. 

Now, since the perpendicular from on any side of the 
polygon is equal to the radius of the circle, while the perimeter 
of the polygon is greater than the circumference of the circle, 
it follows that the area of the polygon is greater than the 
triangle K\ which is impossible. 



MEASUREMENT OF A CIRCLE. 93 

Therefore the area of the circle is not less than K. 
Since then the area of the circle is neither greater nor less 
than K 9 it is equal to it. 

Proposition 2. 

The area of a circle is to the square on its diameter as 11 
to 14. 

[The text of this proposition is not satisfactory, and Archi- 
medes cannot have placed it before Proposition 3, as the 
approximation depends upon the result of that proposition,] 

Proposition 3. 

The ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter 
is less than 3f but greater than 



[In view of the interesting questions arising out of the 
arithmetical content of this proposition of Archimedes, it is 
necessary, in reproducing it, to distinguish carefully the actual 
steps set out in the text as we have it from the intermediate 
steps (mostly supplied by Eutocius) which it is convenient to 
put in for the purpose of making the proof easier to follow. 
Accordingly all the steps not actually appearing in the text 
have been enclosed in square brackets, in order that it may be 
clearly seen how far Archimedes omits actual calculations and 
only gives results. It will be observed that he gives two 
fractional approximations to \/3 (one being less and the other 
greater than the real value) without any explanation as to how 
he arrived at them ; and in like manner approximations to the 
square roots of several large numbers which are not complete 
squares are merely stated. These various approximations and 
the machinery of Greek arithmetic in general will be found 
discussed in the Introduction, Chapter IV.] 

I. Let AB be the diameter of any circle, its centre, AC 
the tangent at A ; and let the angle A OC be one-third of a 
right angle. 



94 ARCHIMEDES 

Then OA : AC\=f& : 1]>265 : 153 (1), 

and OC : CA [=2 : 1] = 306 : 153 (2). 

First, draw OD bisecting the angle AOG and meeting AC 
inD. 

Now CO : OA = CD: DA, [Eucl. VI. 3] 

so that [CO + OA:OA = CA: DA, or] 

CO + OA :CA = OA : AD. 
Therefore [by (1) and (2)] 

OA :AD>671 : 153 (3). 

Hence OD* : A D* [= (OA* + AD*) : AD* 

> (571 s + 153') :153 2 ] 

> 349450 : 23409, 

so that OD :DA>591% : 153 (4). 




Secondly, let OE bisect the angle AOD, meeting AD in E. 
[Then DO : OA = DE : EA, 

so that DO + OA : DA = OA : AE.] 

Therefore OA : AE [> (591 + 571) : 153, by (3) and (4)] 

(5). 



MEASUREMENT OF A CIRCLE. 95 

[It follows that 

OE* : EA* > {(1162) 2 + 153 2 } : 153 s 

> (1350534|f + 23409) : 23409 

> 1373943ff : 23409.] 

Thus OE:EA> 1172 : 153 ..................... (6). 



Thirdly, let OF bisect the angle AOE and meet AE in F. 

We thus obtain the result [corresponding to (3) and (5) 

above] that 

OA : AF[> (1162 + 1172) : 153] 

>2334: 153 ..................... (7). 

[Therefore OF* : FA 2 > {(2334J) 2 + 153 2 } : 153 2 

> 5472132^ : 23409.] 
Thus OF:FA>23M:153 ..................... (8). 

Fourthly, let OG bisect the angle AOF, meeting AF in (?. 
We have then 

OA : AG [> (2334J + 2339J) : 153, by means of (7) and (8)] 
> 4673^:153. 

Now the angle AOC, which is one-third of a right angle, 
has been bisected four times, and it follows that 



Z A 00 ? ^ (a right angle). 

Make the angle AOH on the other side of OA equal to the 
angle A OG, and let OA produced meet OH in H. 

Then Z GOH=^ (a right angle). 

Thus GH is one side of a regular polygon of 96 sides cir- 
cumscribed to the given circle. 

And, since OA : AG > 4673 : 153, 
while AE = 20 A, GH = 2AG, 

it follows that 

A B : (perimeter of polygon of 96 sides) [> 4673J : 153 x 96] 

^ 4673 J: 14688.

<3f 

Therefore the circumference of the circle (being less than 
the perimeter of the polygon) is a fortiori less than 3f times 
the diameter AB. 

II. Next let AB be the diameter of a circle, and let AC, 
meeting the circle in C y make the angle CAB equal to one-third 
of a right angle. Join BG. 

Then AC : CB [= V3 : 1] < 1351 : 780. 

First, let AD bisect the angle BAG and meet BC in d and 
the circle in D. Join BD. 

Then 



and the angles at -D, C are both right angles. 

It follows that the triangles ADB, [ACd], BDd are similar. 




Therefore 



AD:DB = BD: Dd 

[=AC:Cd] 

= AB:Bd 



[Eucl. VI. 3] 



or 



=AB+AC:BC 
BA+AC:BC=AD:DB. 



MEASUREMENT OF A CIRCLE. 97 

[But AC : CB< 1351 : 780, from above, 

while BA :5tf=2:l 

- 1560 : 780.] 

Therefore 4D :ZXB< 2911 : 780 (1). 

[Hence A B* : BD* < (291 1* + 780*) : 780* 

< 9082321 : 608400.] 
Thus AB :BD< 3013f : 780 (2). 

Secondly, let AE bisect the angle BAD, meeting the circle 
in E\ and let BE be joined. 

Then we prove, in the same way as before, that 
AE: EB[=BA + AD-.BD 

< (3013| + 2911) : 780, by (1) and (2)] 

< 5924f : 780 

< 5924f x js : 780 x & 

<1823 : 240 (3). 

[Hence A B* : BE 9 < (1823 2 + 240 2 ) : 240* 
< 3380929 : 57600.] 

Therefore AB : BE < 1838 T \ : 240 (4). 

Thirdly, let AF bisect the angle BAE t meeting the circle 
in F. 

Thus AF : FB [= BA + AE : BE 

< 3661.fr : 240, by (3) and (4)] 

< 3661 T 9 T x ii : 240 x U 
<1007 :66 (5). 

[It follows that 

AB 9 : BF* < (1007 s + 66') : 66* 

< 1018405 : 4356.] 
Therefore AB : BF< 1009 : 66 (6). 

Fourthly, let the angle BAF be bisected by AG meeting the 
circle in G. 

Then AG : GB [= BA + AF : BF] 

< 2016J : 66, by (5) and (6). 

H. A. 7 



98 ARCHIMEDES 

[And Aff : BQ* < {(2016J)' + 66 2 } : 66' 

< 4069284^ : 4356.] 
Therefore AB : BQ < 2017* : 66, 
whence BG : AB > 66 : 2017J (7). 

[Now the angle SAG which is the result of the fourth bisection 
of the angle BAG, or of one- third of a right angle, is equal to 
one-fortyeighth of a right angle. 

Thus the angle subtended by BG at the centre is 
Jj (a right angle).] 

Therefore BG is a side of a regular inscribed polygon of 9(> 
sides. 

It follows from (7) that 

(perimeter of polygon) : AB [> 96 x 66 : 20l7] 

> 6336: 2017 J. 

A A 6336 010 

And 2bl7i >8 W- 

Much more then is the circumference of the circle greater than 
times the diameter. 

Thus the ratio of the circumference to the diameter
